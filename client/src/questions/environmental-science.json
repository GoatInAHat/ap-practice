However, the amount of acidity that is deposited in rainwater is much less, on average, than that created through agricultural activities. Acid soils are most often found in areas of high rainfall. Additionally, rainwater has a slightly acidic pH of 5.7 due to a reaction with CO<span class=\"sub\">2</span> in the atmosphere that forms carbonic acid. Ammonium (NH<span class=\"sub\">4</span><span class=\"sup\">+</span>) fertilizers react in the soil in a process called nitrification to form nitrate (NO<span class=\"sub\">3</span><span class=\"sup\">-</span>), and, in the process, they release H<sup>+</sup> ions.

It determines the amount of water available for weathering minerals, transporting the minerals, and releasing elements. Climate, through its influence on soil temperature, determines the rate of chemical weathering. Warm, moist climates encourage rapid plant growth and thus high organic matter production. The opposite is true for cold, dry climates. Organic matter decomposition is also accelerated in warm, moist climates. Climate controls freezing, thawing, wetting, and drying, which break parent material apart. Rainfall causes leaching. Rain dissolves some minerals, such as carbonates, and transports them deeper into the soil. Some acidic soils have developed from parent materials that originally contained limestone. Rainfall can also be acidic, especially downwind from industrial processes.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>A soil sample was analyzed and found to contain 30% clay, 60% sand, and 10% silt.

The worst soils to build upon include deep, loose sand; silty clays; sand and gravel; and soft, saturated granular soils. Earthquake forces are amplified on water-saturated soils, changing the soil from a solid to a liquid, a process known as liquefaction. Liquefaction makes the ground incapable of supporting a foundation. During liquefaction, the ground can crack or heave, causing uneven settling or building collapse. The best soils to build upon to reduce damage from earthquakes are bedrock (deep and unbroken rock formations) and stiff soils.

The result is that air will move from the high-pressure area to an area of lower pressure. Clear skies and fair weather usually occur in these regions. On the other hand, winds tend to blow into a low-pressure system because air moves from areas of higher pressure into areas of lower pressure. As winds blow into a low-pressure system, the air moves up.

It is a common occurrence along coasts during the morning as solar radiation heats the land more quickly than the water. A land breeze, or offshore breeze, is the reverse effect, caused by land cooling more quickly than water in the evening. The sea breeze dissipates and the wind flows from the land toward the sea.

In restricting population growth, a density-dependent factor intensifies as the population size increases, affecting each individual more strongly. Population growth declines because of death rate increase, birth rate decrease, or both. There is a reduction in the food supply, which restricts reproduction resulting in less offspring. The competition for space to establish territories is a behavioral mechanism that may restrict population growth. Predators concentrate in areas where there is a high concentration of prey. As long as the natural resources are available in sufficient quantity, the population will remain constant. As the population decreases, so do predators. The accumulation of toxic wastes may also limit the size of a population. Intrinsic factors may play a role in limiting a population size. High densities may cause stress syndromes, resulting in hormonal changes that may delay the onset of reproduction. It has also been reported that immune disorders are related to stress in high densely populated areas. Density-independent factors include weather, climate, and natural disasters such as freezes, seasonal changes, hurricanes, and fires.

During the Carboniferous Period, the atmosphere became greatly depleted of CO<sub>2</sub> (declining from about 2,500 ppm to 350 ppm) so that by the end of the Carboniferous Period the atmosphere was less favorable to plant life and plant growth slowed. Today, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations are approximately 380 ppm (0.038% of our atmosphere).

The cycle begins every year around June when vortex winds develop in the Antarctic. Cold temperatures produced by these winds create polar stratospheric clouds that capture floating chlorofluoro-carbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting compounds. For the next two months, a reaction occurs on the cloud surface that frees the chlorine in the CFCs but keeps it contained within the vortex. In September, sunlight returns to the Antarctic and triggers a chemical reaction, causing chlorine to convert ozone to oxygen gas.

Predation, competition for resources, disease, limited food and space, etc., all work to hold a population in check. Environmental resistance can be either density-dependent or density-independent. Factors that are density-dependent are stronger when a population has a higher density (more crowded). Examples would include predation, parasitism, disease, and competition for space or food. Density-independent factors (usually abiotic) will kill organisms\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhether they are crowded or not. Examples would include floods, storms, earthquakes, fire, etc. In nature, biotic potential and environmental resistance work together to level out population numbers to an amount that can be supported by the environment.

The identification of strata or rock layers by the fossils they contained enabled geologists to correlate strata between continents. If two strata (however far apart or different in composition) contained the same fossils, it was likely they had been laid down at the same time. The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in an undisturbed sequence is younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from the deposition of the lowest layer to the deposition of the highest bed.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "E"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>Which biome, found primarily in the eastern United States, central Europe, and eastern Asia, is home to some of the world's largest cities and has probably endured the impact of humans more than any other biome?</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A.

As it passes Europe, the surface water evaporates and the ocean water cools, releasing heat to the atmosphere. This release of heat is largely responsible for the relatively warm temperatures enjoyed by western Europe. As the water becomes colder, it increases in salinity and becomes dense, sinking thousands of feet below the surface. The deep water slowly travels south through the oceanic abyss, eventually mixing upward to the surface in different parts of the world up to 1,000 years later.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>An agricultural consequence of higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere for most crops is</p><p>I. decreased nitrogen levels in the crop and their seeds</p><p>II. increased nitrogen levels in the crop and their seeds</p><p>III. larger crop yields</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A.

It is present in all modern cities, but it is more common in cities with sunny, warm, dry climates and a large number of motor vehicles.

Biodiversity is not evenly distributed; rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things (biota) depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography, and the presence of other species. Generally, there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics. Thus, localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher latitudes.

Disease, food supply, and other predators are variables in this complex relationship. Every ten years or so, the hares' reproduction rate increases. As more hares are born, they eat more of their food supply. They eat so much food that they are forced to supplement their diet with less desirable and nutritious food. As the hare population grows, the lynx population begins to increase in response. Because there are so many hares, other predators opportunistically begin to hunt them along with the lynxes. The hares' less nutritious and varied diet begins to have an effect; the hares begin to die due to illness and disease and fewer hares are born because there is less food. The hare population begins to go into a steep decline. Therefore, the lynx population also begins to decline. Some lynxes starve and others die due to disease. Both the lynx and hare populations have fewer offspring, and this decrease in population gives the vegetation a chance to recover. Once there is enough vegetation for the hares to begin to increase their population, the whole cycle begins again.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>\"We can burn coal to produce electricity to operate a refrigerator\" is an example of the ___________ and \"If we burn coal to produce electricity to operate a refrigerator, we lose a great deal of energy in the form of heat\" is an example of the ____________</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. first law of thermodynamics, first law of thermodynamics</label>", "B": "<label>B. second law of thermodynamics, first law of thermodynamics</label>", "C": "<label>C. first law of thermodynamics, second law of thermodynamics</label>", "D": "<label>D. first law of thermodynamics, third law of thermodynamics</label>", "E": "<label>E. third law of thermodynamics, first law of thermodynamics</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">C</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">(C)</span> The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be changed from one form to another but it cannot be created or destroyed.

Nitrous oxide is the fourth largest contributor to greenhouse gases ranked behind water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. </p><p>Radon (Rn) is a radioactive element and occurs naturally as the decay product of uranium and thorium. Radon sticks to dust particles in the air. If contaminated dust is inhaled, these particles can stick to the airways of the lung and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Radon is responsible for the majority of the public exposure to radiation. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics and basements.

Secondary waves (S waves) arrive at seismograph stations after the faster moving P waves during an earthquake and displace the ground perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S waves can travel only through solids. S waves are about 60% slower than P waves. Surface waves are analogous to water waves and travel along Earth's surface.

These changes include accumulation of organic matter in the litter or humic layer, alteration of soil nutrients, and change in pH or water content of soil. These pioneer plants are then dominated and often replaced by plants better adapted to less austere conditions, such as grasses and shrubs that are able to live in thin, mineral-based soils.

Choice (B) explains why glaciers haven't ripped away surface layers, but says nothing about organic deposits, so eliminate it. Choice (C) gives a reason why metamorphic rock, not organic matter or fossil fuels, would be found in the area: eliminate it as well. Choice (D) is closer, because the seabed of an ancient ocean is likely to have large deposits of organic matter. However, it doesn't explain any geologic forces that could have formed that matter into petroleum. Choice (A) contains the elements you need: deposits of ancient sediment (which would include organic matter), and a geologic process (subsidence) that would put the matter under pressure and could form fossil fuels.

About 30\u201340% of the carbon dioxide that's released into the atmosphere due to human activities ends up in seawater and lakes and rivers. CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), and some of the carbonic acid molecules separate into bicarbonate ions (HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>). The increase in hydrogen ions is interpreted as an increase in acidity.
