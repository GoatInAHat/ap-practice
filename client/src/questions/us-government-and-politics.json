The federal government also has a set of laws, and violations of these are tried in federal courts. Occasionally, the two legal systems overlap. For example, the defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing trial destroyed a federal building and killed federal employees, all federal crimes. Clearly the bombing also violated state laws prohibiting murder, destruction of property, and reckless endangerment.

Nor does the Constitution enumerate the limits on those powers, except in the broadest of terms. Consequently, presidents are often left to define for themselves the limits of their powers under such mandates as \"Commander in Chief\" and \"Head of State.\" Presidential power is accordingly fluid, dependent on the popularity and skills of the office holder.

Through the second midterm election of his tenure, the president carries considerable influence with the electorate and therefore can persuade Congress to cooperate through threats (such as \"I will campaign against you, and you will lose\"). Once that threat has passed, the president, no longer able to run for reelection, loses political capital. Congress accordingly defers to him less frequently. A president saddled with a Congress led by the opposing party will also experience a diminution in power because his ability to implement his programs will meet a challenge from the legislature. Bill Clinton proved adept at accomplishing some goals despite opposition from a Republican Congress; nonetheless, divided control of the legislative and executive branches unquestionably weakens a president.</p><p>Incorrect Answers:</p><p>(A) As noted in the discussion of (C), this is true, but it's not the only reason.</p><p>(B) International crises often do exactly the opposite, which is to strengthen the president's position.

Some such defendants include the police officers who were captured on videotape beating Rodney King in Los Angeles, and a young African American who stabbed a rabbinical student in Brooklyn during a racially charged riot.

If 30% of the members of Congress are of the president's party, then approximately 70% are not. In that scenario, the opposition party is more likely to attain the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto, so (A) is the best choice. If the scenario in (B) were to occur, Congress might be more likely to override a veto than if the public were opposed to the bill; however, reaching a two-thirds majority in Congress is usually very difficult and likely to occur only when a single party has a strong majority in each house. Choices (C) and (D) are irrelevant to overriding a presidential veto. Choice (E) is incorrect, for if the proposed legislation had been adopted by a narrow margin (51%, for example), it would be very unlikely that two-thirds of each house would vote to overturn a veto.

Furthermore, most states have \"winner take all\" rules regarding electoral votes: this means that the candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes. Therefore, during the general election, candidates tend to campaign in states with large populations in an attempt to garner a windfall of electoral votes.

The process of amending the Constitution illustrates this sharing of power, making (A) the best answer. A proposed amendment to the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate and ratification (approval) from at least three-fourths of the states.

Choice (A) is incorrect because the Constitution creates a republic, or representative democracy, in which decisions are made by elected representatives. Direct democracy empowers voters to make legislative decisions, such as ballot initiatives, referendums, and recall elections. This occurs in some states but not in the federal government. Choice (C) is incorrect because each state has equal representation in the Senate but representation in the House is proportional to population.

Choice (D) is incorrect because only a central government exercises power in a unitary system: the Constitution establishes a system of federalism, in which power is shared between the federal government and the states. Choice (E) is incorrect because suffrage is the right to vote, and many people were not permitted to vote in 1787.

In 2013, the Supreme Court's ruling in <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em> put the future of the VRA in doubt. The court struck down Section 4(b) of the VRA, which determines which states are subject to the preclearance requirement. Until Congress revises Section 4(b), no states are subject to the preclearance requirement. Since the preclearance provision, effective or not, would not reduce voter turnout, (A) is the best. Choices (B) is incorrect because \"low levels of political efficacy\" means voters don't believe they can affect the outcome of an election; therefore, low levels of political efficacy would decrease voter turnout. Because some voters don't have photo identification, laws that require voters to show identification prevent voters from casting their ballots; therefore, (C) should be eliminated. Choice (D) is incorrect because voters are less likely to vote when there are frequent elections. Voters are less likely to participate in weekday elections than in weekend elections since they must take time off work to vote on a weekday; therefore, (E) should be eliminated.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "A"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>A \"motion for cloture\" is used to</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. send a bill back to the House</label>", "B": "<label>B. override a presidential veto in the House</label>", "C": "<label>C. amend an appropriations bill in the House</label>", "D": "<label>D. end a filibuster and force a vote on a bill in the Senate</label>", "E": "<label>E. block a vote on a presidential appointee in the Senate</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">D</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>D</strong> A senator enacts a \"motion for cloture\" to end a filibuster and force a vote on a bill.

For example, a newspaper, radio station, and television channel may choose to cover three different events or provide three different perspectives on an issue. However, if they share the same owner, they're more likely to cover the same events and express the same ideas. The cost of political ads on TV is increasing, as is the cost of newspapers, so you can eliminate (D) and (E) right away. An increased presence of individual candidates giving individual viewpoints contributes to diversity in news coverage, so eliminate (B) too. Choice (A) is controversial\u00e2\u20ac\u201dconservative media critics tend to see increasing liberal bias in news media, because most reporters hold liberal views.

Although senators are elected for six-year terms, senatorial elections are staggered so that only one-third of the Senate is elected every two years. Senators are elected in statewide, at-large elections (A), resulting in a larger and, therefore, more diverse, constituency (E). The prestige of the Senate leads to more media interest (B).

The few states that have same-day registration have shown an increase in voter turnout (C). In recent years, party loyalty has tended to decrease (E).

The Anti-Masonic Party was a single-issue party that had some influence from 1828 to 1838; in the 1832 presidential election the Anti-Masonic candidate received 7.8% of the popular vote. The Free-Soil Party was an anti-slavery party that was active in the 1848 and 1852 presidential elections, but by 1854 most of its members had joined the Republican Party. The Republican Party was not founded until 1854, long after the era of Jacksonian democracy. The Know-Nothing Party existed from 1845 to 1860; the big issue for Know-Nothings was the fear of Catholic immigration.

The existence of many parties with divergent beliefs gives voters more choices in elections. However, there are many disadvantages to multi-party systems. As responses (A) and (B) suggest, one party seldom emerges victorious and, as a result, coalition governments have to be formed. These coalitions are often volatile and sometimes dissolve very quickly.
