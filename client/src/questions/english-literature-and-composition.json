Metonymy, (A), is a thing or concept that is not called by its own name, but by the name of something intimately associated with that thing or concept. This is often confused with synecdoche, as they're both part/whole concepts, but the key here is common association. Robert and Mrs. Pontellier are not commonly associated with a sunshade. Apostrophe, (B), is when a speaker <a></a>addresses a person or object in a rhetorical manner, not expecting an answer, and is not used in this passage. Hyperbole, (C), the purposeful use of exaggerated speech, is not related to the \"sunshade\" episode. Had the sunshade been referred to as \"walking\" or \"crawling its way across the lawn,\" then personification, (D), would be correct. As it is, the sunshade is used to refer to not only itself, but the two people carrying it up to the house as well, which is an example of synecdoche.

Mr. Pontellier's charged and scolding statements toward his wife are, essentially, the opposite of this. Apostrophe, (E), is when a speaker addresses a person or object in a rhetorical manner, not expecting an answer to their addressing of it, and though Robert and Mrs. Pontellier do not respond to Mr. Pontellier's braying, he was, likely, expecting a response from them.

Most students choose (E), five. But the past is not a speaker. The past is being interpreted for the principal narrator by the Soul. Another choice that sophisticated readers sometimes pick is (A), one. The reasoning behind choosing (A) is usually that only the poet is speaking; the Soul, World, and God represent elements and ideas within the poet. In this reading, the poem is a kind of internal monologue in which the poet sorts out her feelings about death and the afterlife. This interpretation is absolutely plausible. (Rossetti certainly did not intend for you to think she had actually held a conversation with the World or with God.) The problem is that it is an <span class=\"italic\">interpretation</span>. The question asks, \"How many speakers does the poem present?\" The emphasis is on what the poem presents, not what the poem might suggest.

This question is an example of the latter.</p><p>In ancient Greek and Roman society, a garland of laurel and bay leaves was awarded in recognition of triumph in sports, war, or poetry.

The third stanza presents a dramatic reversal in the poem's meaning and direction by refiguring imagery from the previous stanzas with an antithetical meaning.

But the question asks for the meaning of Winter in the <span class=\"italic\">third</span> stanza. In this stanza God says that now \"Winter passeth after the long delay.\" What follows are images of spring now clearly tied to death and the afterlife.

Choice (D) is wrong for the same reason: Lawyers are better than townsmen just as poets are better than chronographers. Choice (E), angels, is a little tricky, because poetry is said to be \"the very phrase of angels\" (lines 57\u201358), which might imply that poets are the angels speaking the phrases. But that sentence is talking about poetry as a concept, not about poets as members of society. And even conceited poets don't generally compare themselves to angels, certainly not in the middle of such a satirical piece. Even if you were confused by that, you should be able to see that lawyers is a direct comparison while \"angels\" requires some overreading and stretching.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "A"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>An Invective Against Enemies of Poetry</p><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-literature/cr2017/00073.jpg\"/></p><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-literature/cr2017/00074.jpg\"/></p><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-literature/cr2017/00075.jpg\"/></p></pre><p>Line 9 is an example of</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. metaphor</label>", "B": "<label>B. onomatoepeia</label>", "C": "<label>C. paradox</label>", "D": "<label>D. alliteration</label>", "E": "<label>E. apostrophe</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">D</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The phrase \"the pilferies of your pen to polish\" is an example of alliteration, which means using the same initial consonant sound repeatedly in a line.

In the face of such great love, one would think that she would have the power to break his heart, but that is not mentioned in the specified lines, so you can eliminate (A). He does mention dying in these lines but mostly in the context of her power over the elements; he warns her against teaching the oceans and winds how to kill him, not against killing him herself.

But this is also a question in which you can use POE. Choice (A) is obviously wrong: Louisa is not bitter or domineering, but that was thrown in there in case you confused Louisa with her fears about her future mother-in-law. Choice (B) is partly right because Louisa is naive, but she is not shown doing anything childish. You might argue that her preconceptions about men are somewhat childish, but that would be overreading the text. Choice (C) is also alluring because \"frightened\" seems to relate to the end of the passage in which Louisa \"trembles,\" but there are lots of reasons for trembling, and \"foolish\" doesn't really fit. You might find Louisa's ideas about men foolish, but her contemplation of how her upcoming marriage will change her life is certainly realistic enough, in its way. Choice (E) might also appeal because of our sympathy for Caesar, but <a></a>Louisa also loves the dog and nothing in her behavior is deliberately cruel. Therefore, the only really acceptable answer is (D). Louisa is certainly sheltered and knows it, and she is also innocent insofar as she believes what she is told about Caesar, Joe, and Joe's mother. But more importantly, she believes in the conventional wisdom regarding the difficulties of married life.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>The passage, an excerpt from a short story by Mary E.

Choice (A) is almost ridiculous: The only thing that comes close to a reference to farming in this selection is Louisa's distilling of herbs, and that doesn't seem to involve any seasonal harvest ritual. Besides, harvest rituals and their goddesses are usually sexual, which is precisely what Louisa's maidenly activities aren't. Choice (C) is wrong because there is nothing to suggest that Louisa is mentally ill. Choice (D) is wrong because, although Louisa has \"almost the enthusiasm of an artist\" while cleaning her house, there is nothing to suggest that she is a genius of any kind. Choice (E) is tempting because Louisa is engaged in many traditional tasks, but because she anticipates that her mother-in-law and husband will make her stop many of her less-productive activities, they are probably not the highest values of the town. This leaves (B). Note that (B) uses the phrase <span class=\"italic\">feminine cultural sphere,</span> which is a term widely used in feminist criticism to indicate traditionally feminine activities.

It is also where we get the idea of people being \"in a good humor.\" The bitten neighbor is described as \"choleric,\" which is another reference to the theory of humors. Louisa is deliberately feeding her dog bland food to discourage any further attacks on the neighbors. She is not poor or she would not be able to have such nice things in her house, so (A) is false. The passage does speak metaphorically of Caesar's imprisonment, but Louisa is not deliberately punishing her dog, certainly not for a decade, so (B) is also incorrect. There are many references to hermits and nuns in this story, but dogs do not practice celibacy as a religious practice, so (D) is wrong.

That drinks are served by a \"beautiful boy\" rather than by an adult also contributes to the picture of a low-key, quiet place.

Virtually every line rhymes with another, although the rhyming lines, except for 36-37, are sometimes two or more lines apart. The rhymes create a repetition of sound that may be likened to the waves breaking on the beach, but like the waves themselves, they are not evenly spaced nor of the same intensity. Likewise, the rhythm is irregular. In some parts of the poem (lines 10-11 and 32-33, for example) short phrases-usually iambic feet-suggest small, quick, repetitive waves. But intermittently, the rhythm slows, as in \"Sophocles long ago/Heard it on the Aegean\" (lines 15-16), mimicking long, slow rolling waves.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "A"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p class=\"center\"><b>Dover Beach</b></p><p><span class=\"tm\"></span>The sea is calm tonight,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Upon the straits;\u2014on the French coast the light<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">05</span>Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Only, from the long line of spray<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Listen! you hear the grating roar<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>At their return, up the high strand,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Begin, and cease, and then again begin,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The eternal note of sadness in.<br/><br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>Sophocles long ago<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Of human misery;<sup><small>1</small></sup> we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Find also in the sound a thought,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Hearing it by this distant northern sea.<br/><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Sea of Faith<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>But now I only hear<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Retreating, to the breath<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>And naked shingles of the world.<br/><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Ah, love, let us be true<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>To one another! for the world, which seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>So various, so beautiful, so new,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>And we are here as on a darkling<sup><small>2</small></sup> plain<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Where ignorant armies clash by night.</p><p class=\"right\">\u2014 Matthew Arnold, c. 1850</p><p><sup><small>1</small></sup> An allusion to Sophocles' <i>Antigone</i><br/><sup><small>2</small></sup> dark, deeply shadowed</p></pre><p>In the poem, the sea is depicted primarily through its</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. colors</label>", "B": "<label>B. movement</label>", "C": "<label>C. sounds</label>", "D": "<label>D. smells</label>", "E": "<label>E. tides</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">C</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">(C)</span> In line 9, the speaker says, \"Listen!\" and then cites such sounds as the \"roar of pebbles,\" and the \"tremulous cadence\" of the sea.

There<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>can be no question about that; but I suppose<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>there are very few people who can understand<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>them. I never knew but one man who could. I<br/><span class=\"tmk\">05</span>knew he could, however, because he told me<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of California, among the woods and mountains,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a good many years, and had studied the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>birds, until he believed he could accurately<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>translate any remark which they made. This<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was Jim Baker. According to Jim Baker, some<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>animals have only a limited education, and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>use only very simple words, and scarcely ever<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a comparison or a flowery figure; whereas, certain<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>other animals have a large vocabulary, a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>fine command of language and a ready and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>fluent delivery; consequently these latter talk<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>a great deal; they like it; they are conscious<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of their talent, and they enjoy \"showing off.\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Baker said, that after long and careful observation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>he had come to the conclusion that the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>bluejays were the best talkers he had found<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>among the birds and beasts. Said he:<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"There's more?to?a bluejay than any other<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>creature. He has got more moods, and more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>different kinds of feelings than other creatures;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and, mind you, whatever a bluejay feels, he<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>can put into language. And no mere commonplace<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>language, either, but rattling, out-and-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>out book-talk\u2014and bristling with metaphor,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>too\u2014just bristling! And as for command of language\u2014<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>why?you?never see a bluejay get stuck<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>for a word. No man ever did. They just boil out<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of him! And another thing: I've noticed a good<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>deal, and there's no bird, or cow, or anything<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that uses as good grammar as a blue-jay. You<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>may say a cat uses good grammar. Well, a cat<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>does\u2014but you let a cat get excited once; you<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>shed, nights, and you'll hear grammar that will<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>give you lockjaw. Ignorant people think it's the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>noise?which fighting cats make that is so aggravating,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>but it ain't so; it's the sickening grammar<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>they use. Now I've never heard a jay use<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>bad grammar but very seldom; and when they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>do, they are as ashamed as a human; they shut<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>right down and leave.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">50</span>\"You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a measure\u2014because he's got feathers on him,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and don't belong to no church, perhaps; but<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>otherwise he is just as much a human as you<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>be. And I'll tell you for why. A jay's gifts, and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whole ground. A jay hasn't got any more principle<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than a Congressman. A jay will lie, a jay<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>four times out of five, a jay will go back on his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">60</span>solemnest promise. The sacredness of an obligation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>is a thing which you can't cram into no<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>bluejay's head. Now, on top of all this, there's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>another thing a jay can outswear any gentleman<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the mines. You think a cat can swear.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">65</span>Well, a cat can; but you give a bluejay a subject<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that calls for his reserve-powers, and where is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>your cat? Don't talk to?me\u2014I know too much<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about this thing. And there's yet another thing;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the one little particular of scolding\u2014just<br/><span class=\"tmk\">70</span>good, clean, out-and-out scolding\u2014a bluejay<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>can lay over anything, human or divine. Yes, sir,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a jay is everything a man is. A jay can cry, a jay<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and plan and discuss, a jay likes gossip and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">75</span>scandal, a jay has got a sense of humor, a jay<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knows when he is an ass just as well as you do\u2014<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>maybe better. If a jay ain't human, he better take<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in his sign, that's all. Now I'm going to tell you a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>perfectly true fact about some bluejays.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">80</span>\"When I first begun to understand jay language<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>correctly, there was a little incident happened<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>here. Seven years ago, the last man in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>this region but me moved away.

He was a middle-aged, simple-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of California, among the woods and mountains,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a good many years, and had studied the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>birds, until he believed he could accurately<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>translate any remark which they made. This<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was Jim Baker.

He was a middle-aged, simple-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of California, among the woods and mountains,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a good many years, and had studied the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>birds, until he believed he could accurately<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>translate any remark which they made.

There<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>can be no question about that; but I suppose<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>there are very few people who can understand<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>them. I never knew but one man who could. I<br/><span class=\"tmk\">05</span>knew he could, however, because he told me<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of California, among the woods and mountains,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a good many years, and had studied the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>birds, until he believed he could accurately<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>translate any remark which they made. This<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was Jim Baker.

And another thing: I've noticed a good<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>deal, and there's no bird, or cow, or anything<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that uses as good grammar as a blue-jay. You<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>may say a cat uses good grammar.

He was a middle-aged, simple-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of California, among the woods and mountains,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a good many years, and had studied the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>birds, until he believed he could accurately<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>translate any remark which they made.

He was a middle-aged, simple-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of California, among the woods and mountains,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a good many years, and had studied the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>birds, until he believed he could accurately<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>translate any remark which they made.

(B) has some validity because the fading of the knight's cheeks and the pallor on his forehead might be interpreted as foreshadowing his death, but these qualities are more akin to a debilitating sorrow than to dying.

Ramsden is simply stating that he's older, and possibly wiser, than Tanner. (D) indicates little more than Tanner is a member of England's educated class.

The nature of my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>avocations, for the last thirty years, has brought<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>me into more than ordinary contact with what<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>would seem an interesting and somewhat singular<br/><span class=\"tmk\">05</span>set of men, of whom, as yet, nothing, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I know of, has ever been written\u2014I mean, the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>law-copyists, or scriveners.<sup><small>1</small></sup> I have known very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>many of them, professionally and privately,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and, if I pleased, could relate diverse histories,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>at which good-natured gentlemen might smile,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the biographies of all other scriveners, for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>scrivener, the strangest I ever saw, or heard of.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>While, of other law-copyists, I might write the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>can be done. I believe that no materials exist for<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>except from the original sources, and,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in his case, those are very small. What my own<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, <i>that</i> is all I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>know of him, except, indeed, one vague report,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>which will appear in the sequel.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of myself, my employees, my business, my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>chambers, and general surroundings; because<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>some such description is indispensable to an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>adequate understanding of the chief character<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about to be presented. Imprimis:<sup><small>2</small></sup> I am a man<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who, from his youth upwards, has been filled<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with a profound conviction that the easiest<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>down public applause; but, in the cool tranquillity<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of a snug retreat, do a snug business<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>among rich men's bonds, and mortgages, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>eminently <i>safe</i> man. The late John Jacob Astor,<sup><small>3</small></sup><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had no hesitation in pronouncing my first<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I admit, I love to repeat; for it hath a rounded<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>to the late John Jacob Astor's good opinion.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Some time prior to the period at which this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>little history begins, my avocations had been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>largely increased. The good old office, now<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>extinct in the State of New York, of a Master<br/><span class=\"tmk\">60</span>in Chancery,<sup><small>4</small></sup> had been conferred upon me. It<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>remunerative. I seldom lose my temper;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>much more seldom indulge in dangerous<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>indignation at wrongs and outrages; but, I<br/><span class=\"tmk\">65</span>must be permitted to be rash here, and declare<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the office of Master in Chancery, by the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>new Constitution, as a\u2014premature act; inas-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>much as I had counted upon a life-lease of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">70</span>profits, whereas I only received those of a few<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>short years.

The narrator doesn't denounce the Constitution, only the elimination of the Master in Chancery, a position he hoped to hold for a long time.

The nature of my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>avocations, for the last thirty years, has brought<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>me into more than ordinary contact with what<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>would seem an interesting and somewhat singular<br/><span class=\"tmk\">05</span>set of men, of whom, as yet, nothing, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I know of, has ever been written\u2014I mean, the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>law-copyists, or scriveners.<sup><small>1</small></sup> I have known very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>many of them, professionally and privately,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and, if I pleased, could relate diverse histories,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>at which good-natured gentlemen might smile,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the biographies of all other scriveners, for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>scrivener, the strangest I ever saw, or heard of.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>While, of other law-copyists, I might write the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>can be done. I believe that no materials exist for<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a full and satisfactory biography of this man. It<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>except from the original sources, and,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in his case, those are very small. What my own<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>astonished eyes saw of Bartleby, <i>that</i> is all I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>know of him, except, indeed, one vague report,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>which will appear in the sequel.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>appeared to me, it is fit I make some mention<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of myself, my employees, my business, my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>chambers, and general surroundings; because<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>some such description is indispensable to an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>adequate understanding of the chief character<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about to be presented. Imprimis:<sup><small>2</small></sup> I am a man<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who, from his youth upwards, has been filled<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with a profound conviction that the easiest<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>even to turbulence, at times, yet nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>down public applause; but, in the cool tranquillity<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of a snug retreat, do a snug business<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>among rich men's bonds, and mortgages, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>title-deeds. All who know me, consider me an<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>eminently <i>safe</i> man. The late John Jacob Astor,<sup><small>3</small></sup><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had no hesitation in pronouncing my first<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>do not speak it in vanity, but simply record the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I admit, I love to repeat; for it hath a rounded<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>bullion. I will freely add, that I was not insensible<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>to the late John Jacob Astor's good opinion.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Some time prior to the period at which this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>little history begins, my avocations had been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>largely increased. The good old office, now<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>extinct in the State of New York, of a Master<br/><span class=\"tmk\">60</span>in Chancery,<sup><small>4</small></sup> had been conferred upon me. It<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>remunerative. I seldom lose my temper;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>much more seldom indulge in dangerous<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>indignation at wrongs and outrages; but, I<br/><span class=\"tmk\">65</span>must be permitted to be rash here, and declare<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the office of Master in Chancery, by the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>new Constitution, as a\u2014premature act; inas-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>much as I had counted upon a life-lease of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">70</span>profits, whereas I only received those of a few<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>short years. But this is by the way.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>My chambers were up stairs, at No.\u2014\u2014Wall<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Street. At one end, they looked upon the white<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wall of the interior of a spacious skylight shaft,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">75</span>penetrating the building from top to bottom.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>This view might have been considered rather<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tame than otherwise, deficient in what landscape<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>painters call \"life.\" But, if so, the view from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the other end of my chambers offered, at least, a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">80</span>contrast, if nothing more. In that direction, my<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>windows commanded an unobstructed view of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a lofty brick wall, black by age and everlasting<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>shade; which wall required no spyglass to bring<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>out its lurking beauties, but, for the benefit of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">85</span>all near-sighted spectators, was pushed up to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>within ten feet of my window panes. Owing to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the great height of the surrounding buildings,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and my chambers being on the second floor,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the interval between this wall and mine not a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">90</span>little resembled a huge square cistern.</p><p><sup><small>1</small></sup> Clerks whose job was to copy documents by hand<br/><sup><small>2</small></sup> A legal term meaning \"in the first place\"<br/><sup><small>3</small></sup> In the mid-nineteenth century Astor was one of America's wealthiest men<br/><sup><small>4</small></sup> A type of court that handled issues of fairness; abolished in New York in 1846</p></pre><p>The narrator establishes the tone of the last paragraph (lines 76\u201390), primarily by</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. using the language of aesthetics to describe the views from his office windows</label>", "B": "<label>B. emphasizing black and white visual images</label>", "C": "<label>C. comparing the narrow shaft outside his window with a \"huge square cistern\" (line 90)</label>", "D": "<label>D. exaggerating the size of the surrounding structures</label>", "E": "<label>E. contrasting the view from windows at opposite ends of his office</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">A</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">(A)</span> Both windows face unsightly blank walls.

Afterwards, when it paid, he<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>promptly perceived that upon the whole it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a virtuous undertaking. It paved the way of his<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>ambition; and he enjoyed also the special kind<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of importance he derived from this connection<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with what he imagined to be literature.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>This connection still further enlarged their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>world.

The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>worst was that his gravity, though perfectly<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>portentous, could not be trusted. He sat, elegant<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and bulky, in the drawing-room, the head<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of his stick hovering in front of his big teeth,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and talked for hours with a thick-lipped smile<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(he said nothing that could be considered<br/><span class=\"tmk\">60</span>objectionable and not quite the thing), talked<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in an unusual manner\u2014not obviously\u2014irritatingly.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>His forehead was too lofty\u2014unusually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>so\u2014and under it there was a straight nose, lost<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>between the hairless cheeks, that in a smooth<br/><span class=\"tmk\">65</span>curve ran into a chin shaped like the end of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>snow-shoe. And in this face that resembled the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>face of a fat and fiendishly knowing baby there<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>glinted a pair of clever, peering, unbelieving<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>black eyes. He wrote verses too.

And in this face that resembled the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>face of a fat and fiendishly knowing baby there<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>glinted a pair of clever, peering, unbelieving<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>black eyes.

She had,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in fact, not seen him; she had only written him<br/><span class=\"tmk\">05</span>a long letter. The letter, at least, was long for her;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and, it may be added, that it was long for Morris;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it consisted of five pages, in a remarkably neat<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and handsome hand. Catherine's handwriting<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was beautiful, and she was even a little proud of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>it; she was extremely fond of copying, and possessed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>volumes of extracts which testified to this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>accomplishment; volumes which she had exhibited<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>one day to her lover, when the bliss of feeling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that she was important in his eyes was exceptionally<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>keen. She told Morris, in writing, that her<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>father had expressed the wish that she should not<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>see him again, and that she begged he would not<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>come to the house until she should have 'made<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>up her mind.' Morris replied with a passionate<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>epistle, in which he asked to what, in Heaven's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>name, she wished to make up her mind. Had not<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>her mind been made up two weeks before, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>could it be possible that she entertained the idea<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of throwing him off? Did she mean to break down<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>at the very beginning of their ordeal, after all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the promises of fidelity she had both given and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>extracted? And he gave an account of his own<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>interview with her father\u2014an account not identical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>at all points with that offered in these pages.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>'He was terribly violent,' Morris wrote, 'but you<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>know my self-control. I have need of it all when<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I remember that I have it in my power to break<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in upon your cruel captivity.' Catherine sent him,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in answer to his, a note of three lines. 'I am in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>great trouble; do not doubt my affection, but let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>me wait a little and think.' The idea of a struggle<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with her father, of setting up her will against his<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>own, was heavy on her soul, and it kept her quiet,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as a great physical weight keeps us motionless. It<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>never entered into her mind to throw her lover<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>off; but from the first she tried to assure herself<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that there would be a peaceful way out of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>difficulty. The assurance was vague, for it contained<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>no element of positive conviction that her<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>father would change his mind.

Choice (C) may be implied by the revelation in lines 10-11 that Catherine \"possessed volumes of extracts\" that she had copied, but nothing suggests that the speaker had mentioned it earlier. (D) is not an accurate description of Morris, who claims to have exceptional \"self-control\" (line 31). Naturally, he is outraged by Catherine's letter, but doesn't lose control of his emotions.

Rather, it considers the entire human family and the never-ending circle of life. As one generation ages, the next one prepares to take its place. And so it goes over and over, each generation \"having to let . . . go\" (line 30) of the previous one. What endures over time, however, are such objects as the pine table (line 18), functioning as it always has but bearing the gouges and distresses of the passing years (lines 18-19).</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p><span class=\"tm\"></span>STREPSIADES: O dear!
