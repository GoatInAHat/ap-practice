If you take the author\u2019s proposal seriously, then four of the answers [(A), (C), (D), and (E)] are plausible; of course, the key is to understand that the author is not making a serious proposal, but, rather, he is satirizing other so-called scientific studies that, under the guise of humanitarianism, tend to offer cruel (if not sadistic) \"solutions\" to poverty.

These are, of course, dubious authorities, indeed, which is one of the sources of humor in the passage.<br/><br/>The easiest and fastest way to use POE in this case is to examine the shortest of the paragraphs, the fourth. Clearly, there are no similes (A) or extended metaphors (C) in the fourth paragraph, so there is no need to check the first or second paragraphs for these rhetorical devices. The other two answers are more esoteric, but logic leads you to eliminate them, even if you do not fully understand them as rhetorical terms.

You can infer several things from the first part of the passage.</p> <ol> <li>The passage is about French Romanticism.</li> <li>Typically, critics agree that French Romanticism begins in the late eighteenth century.</li> <li>Typically, critics agree that Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the first great French Romantic.</li> <li>This author emphasizes that French Romanticism is important much earlier in the eighteenth century.</li> <li>This author believes that the novels of Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost, who wrote Romantic works in the first half of the century, provide good examples of this earlier phenomenon.</li></ol><p>Thus, answer (A) is clearly false; the reverse is true. The same can be said for (B)\u2014few critics believe this; most critics believe that \"the patron saint\" is Rousseau. It is easy to eliminate (D). If the novel is not relevant, then why does the critic spend half of the passage discussing it? It is true that the author proposes drama as an even more relevant genre, but that doesn\u2019t imply that the consideration of the novel was inappropriate.<br/><br/>The author discusses Nivelle de la Chauss\u00e9e along with the group of playwrights; thus, it is reasonable to assume that plays, not novels, are that author\u2019s claim to fame. Therefore, you\u2019re left with (E); and from how the author has described the books and paintings \"often depict emotional contemporary issues.\"</p>\n</div>", "correct": "E"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_048a_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_048b_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_048c_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_048d_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_048e_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_048f_r1.jpg\"/></p></pre><p>It can be inferred from this passage that Romantic works often include</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. scenes in gloomy interiors</label>", "B": "<label>B. battles with Goths</label>", "C": "<label>C. scenes from the Wild West</label>", "D": "<label>D. discussions with neighbors</label>", "E": "<label>E. vividly decorated chambers</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">A</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> You should be able to eliminate choices (B) and (C) right away.

Answer (B) is the only one that posits a positive answer (to \"laud\" means to praise), and it can be eliminated easily because of the word \"linear.\" The final sentence of the first paragraph does laud Browne\u2019s writing, but the author suggests that the reading process is like going through a series of mazes. This is anything but straightforward\u2014or linear. Later in the text, there is an oblique allusion to William Shakespeare (\"the time of Elizabeth\"), but there is nothing resembling a comparison between Browne and Shakespeare; eliminate (D). There is even less reason to suspect that there is any suggestion of a comparison between the author of the passage (Samuel Johnson, by the way) and Browne; so you can eliminate answer (E).

Remember that the passage begins with Browne\u2019s own comment that suggests that greatness originates in a sort of balance between the great qualities and great faults.

We have no reason to suspect that the speaker is a family member, so choice (A) is incorrect. Answer (B) is a trap for those casual readers who note that in the initial part of the text there is a discussion of religion, but fail to see how this fits into a discussion of the heroines in a feminist construct. Answer (D) would be a legitimate answer were it not for the qualifier, \"chauvinist.\" If you had to attach a label to the speaker, it would probably be feminist, not chauvinist.

If the speaker borrowed it from one of Eliot\u2019s critics, she would need to identify the citation somehow; (C), therefore, does not seem plausible.

Answer (D) may be alluring, but be careful not to apply a twenty-first-century point of view to nineteenth-century reality. It may be tempting to see Douglas\u2019s defense of states\u2019 rights as a mask for his true feelings on slavery or, at least, as a poor veil for a racist bias. However, none of that is appropriate to the task at hand. The tone is best described as the tone of a debate; in other words, the speaker attempts to step back and let the force of his words (the voice of reason, if you will) carry the day.

If you understand the term \"synecdoche,\" you increase your odds of getting the question right. This rhetorical figure is a limited form of metonymy (which is defined as any time a characteristic represents something, or something stands for its characteristic). Synecdoche is when a part stands for the whole. In this case, the merchant doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t govern hands, he governs workers, but the workers are mostly manual laborers, so the hands represent the workers (by synecdoche) and reinforce the idea of manual labor. The author employs the word <em>men</em> twice in the paragraph, and the synecdoche also helps with diction. Answer (D) is less important, but surely \"hands\" is a concrete, rather than an abstract, image.

To answer this question correctly, you would need to use POE and your best judgment to eliminate all of the least likely answer choices. The passage is an attack against the intrusion of prosaic life into the realm of art. The panegyric (high praise) of classical language is a key to understanding the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view: \"a language different from that of actual use, a language full of resonant music and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence, or made delicate by fanciful rhyme, jeweled with wonderful words, and enriched with lofty diction.\" In a word, this is poetry.<br/><br/>The writing is far too lyrical for the author of the passage to be a journalist (D) or an actor (E); the latter choice is thrown in for those superficial readers who assume that a passage that purports to deal with English drama should be somehow related to a theatrical term. The same may be said for (C). The author capitalizes \"art\" because he is not discussing painting specifically, but the general realm of artistic creation that encompasses all the arts.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "A"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100a_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100b_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100c_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100d_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100e_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100f_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100g_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100h_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100i_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100j_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100k_r1.jpg\"/></p></pre><p>The author relies principally on which of the following to substantiate his thesis?</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. a faulty analogy</label>", "B": "<label>B. process analysis</label>", "C": "<label>C. deductive reasoning</label>", "D": "<label>D. an accumulation of facts</label>", "E": "<label>E. illustration by example</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">E</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>E</strong> The example is stated rhetorically: \"Take the case of the English drama,\" and lasts for most of the passage. \"Illustration by example\" is definitely the defining rhetorical device of this passage.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "E"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100a_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100b_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100c_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100d_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100e_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100f_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100g_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100h_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100i_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100j_r1.jpg\"/><br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/english-language/cr2012/Revi_9780307944429_epub_100k_r1.jpg\"/></p></pre><p>\"\u2026 when Art surrenders her imaginative medium she surrenders everything\" (lines 54-55) is in the form of</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. a maxim</label>", "B": "<label>B. a chiasmus</label>", "C": "<label>C. an antithesis</label>", "D": "<label>D. an understatement</label>", "E": "<label>E. an analogy</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">A</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A</strong> A maxim is a truism or pithy saying, a gnomic statement similar to a proverb, so (A) is the best answer.<br/><br/>POE can help you narrow down your choices. Clearly, the statement does not compare Art to something else, so you can eliminate (E). If anything, the statement is overstatement (hyperbole), and for that reason (D) can be discarded. For the statement to be an antithesis, the author would have needed to put two things or concepts in opposition, but we have only one element (Art); thus, you can eliminate answer (C). At this point, your chances are fifty-fifty, so you could guess and move on.<br/><br/>But let\u2019s look at (B). A \"chiasmus\" is a syntactic figure wherein the elements in one clause are reversed in another.

You learn to watch other people, but you never watch<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>yourself because you strive against loneliness. If you read a book, or shuffle a deck of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cards, or care for a dog, you are avoiding yourself. The abhorrence of loneliness is as<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>natural as wanting to live at all. If it were otherwise, men would never have bothered<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to make an alphabet, nor to have fashioned words out of what were only animal<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sounds, nor to have crossed continents-each man to see what the other looked like.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Being alone in an aeroplane even for so short a time as a night and a day, irrevocably<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>alone, with nothing to observe but your instruments and your own hands in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>semi-darkness, nothing to contemplate but the size of your small courage, nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to wonder about but the beliefs, the faces, and the hopes rooted in your mind-such<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an experience can be as startling as the first awareness of a stranger walking by your<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>side at night. You are a stranger. It is dark already and I am over the south of Ireland.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are the lights of Cork and the lights are wet; they are drenched with Irish rain,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>and I am above them and dry. I am above them and the plane roars in a sobbing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>world, but it imparts no sadness to me. I feel the security of solitude, the exhilaration<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of escape. So long as I can see the lights and imagine the people walking underneath<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>them, I feel selfishly triumphant, as if I have eluded care and left even the small sorrow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of rain in other hands.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>It is a little over an hour now since I left Abingdon, England. Wales and the Irish<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Sea are behind me like so much time used up. On a long flight distance and time are<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the same. But there had been a moment when Time stopped-and Distance too. It<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was the moment I lifted the blue-and-silver Gull from the aerodrome, the moment<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the photographers aimed their cameras, the moment I felt the craft refuse its burden<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>and strain toward the earth in sullen rebellion, only to listen at last to the persuasion<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of stick and elevators, the dogmatic argument of blueprints that said she had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to fly because the figures proved it. So she had flown, and once airborne, once she<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had yielded to the sophistry of a draughtsman's board, she had said, \"There, I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lifted the weight. Now, where are we bound?\"-and the question had frightened me.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">30</span>We are bound for a place thirty-six hundred miles from here-two thousand miles<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of it unbroken ocean.

You learn to watch other people, but you never watch<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>yourself because you strive against loneliness. If you read a book, or shuffle a deck of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cards, or care for a dog, you are avoiding yourself. The abhorrence of loneliness is as<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>natural as wanting to live at all. If it were otherwise, men would never have bothered<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to make an alphabet, nor to have fashioned words out of what were only animal<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sounds, nor to have crossed continents-each man to see what the other looked like.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Being alone in an aeroplane even for so short a time as a night and a day, irrevocably<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>alone, with nothing to observe but your instruments and your own hands in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>semi-darkness, nothing to contemplate but the size of your small courage, nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to wonder about but the beliefs, the faces, and the hopes rooted in your mind-such<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an experience can be as startling as the first awareness of a stranger walking by your<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>side at night. You are a stranger. It is dark already and I am over the south of Ireland.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are the lights of Cork and the lights are wet; they are drenched with Irish rain,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>and I am above them and dry. I am above them and the plane roars in a sobbing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>world, but it imparts no sadness to me. I feel the security of solitude, the exhilaration<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of escape. So long as I can see the lights and imagine the people walking underneath<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>them, I feel selfishly triumphant, as if I have eluded care and left even the small sorrow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of rain in other hands.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>It is a little over an hour now since I left Abingdon, England. Wales and the Irish<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Sea are behind me like so much time used up. On a long flight distance and time are<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the same. But there had been a moment when Time stopped-and Distance too. It<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was the moment I lifted the blue-and-silver Gull from the aerodrome, the moment<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the photographers aimed their cameras, the moment I felt the craft refuse its burden<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>and strain toward the earth in sullen rebellion, only to listen at last to the persuasion<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of stick and elevators, the dogmatic argument of blueprints that said she had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to fly because the figures proved it. So she had flown, and once airborne, once she<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had yielded to the sophistry of a draughtsman's board, she had said, \"There, I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lifted the weight. Now, where are we bound?\"-and the question had frightened me.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">30</span>We are bound for a place thirty-six hundred miles from here-two thousand miles<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of it unbroken ocean. Most of the way it will be night. We are flying west with the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>night. So there behind me is Cork; and ahead of me is Berehaven Lighthouse.

The ceaseless conflict, the strange echoes of long-forgotten controversies,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the confusion of purpose, the successes which lay deep the seeds of future evils,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the failures that ultimately divert the otherwise inevitable danger, the heroism which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>struggles to the last for a cause foredoomed to defeat, the wickedness which sides<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with right, and the wisdom which huzzas at the triumph of folly-fate, meanwhile,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>through all this turmoil and perplexity, working silently toward the predestined<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>end-all these form together a subject the contemplation of which we surely never<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>weary.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">35</span>But there is yet another and very different species of enjoyment to be derived from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the records of the past, which require a somewhat different method of study in order<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it may be fully tasted. Instead of contemplating, as it were, from a distance, the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>larger aspects of the human drama, we may elect to move in familiar fellowship amid<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the scenes and actors of special periods.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>We may add to the interest we derive from the contemplation of contemporary<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>politics, a similar interest derived from a not less minute and probably more accurate<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge of some comparatively brief passage in the political history of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>past. We may extend the social circle in which we move-a circle perhaps narrowed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and restricted through circumstances beyond our control-by making intimate<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>acquaintances, perhaps even close friends, among a society long departed, but<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>which, when we have once learnt the trick of it, it rests with us to revive.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It is this kind of historical reading which is usually branded as frivolous and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>useless, and persons who indulge in it often delude themselves into thinking that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the real motive of their investigation into bygone scenes and ancient scandals is<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>philosophic interest in an important historical episode, whereas in truth it is not<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the philosophy which glorifies the details, but the details that make tolerable the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>philosophy.</p></pre><p>The passage as a whole can best be described as</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. a tribute to historians</label>", "B": "<label>B. an analysis of problems faced by serious historians</label>", "C": "<label>C. an objective report on the value of studying history</label>", "D": "<label>D. a reflection on the rewards of reading history</label>", "E": "<label>E. an attack on a traditional theory of history</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">D</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"bold\">(D)</span> Early in the passage the speaker rejects the notion that history is most useful as a key to predicting the future.

an excerpt from a 20th-century book.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Both the city and the Italian Colony were progressing steadily when the 1906<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>earthquake and fire struck. San Francisco had been razed by fires six times from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>1849 to 1851, and each time the ruins had been swept away and the city rebuilt in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a much finer fashion.

The Italian Quarter, as other<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>parts of the city hit by the disaster, had been reduced to a knotted, tangled mass<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>of bent steel frames, charred bricks, and ashes. In North Beach, only a small part<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the community remained. The Italians on Telegraph Hill had been luckier than<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>most, although they suffered losses since insurance companies were not interested<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in insuring remote areas of the Hill. The scattered fire hydrants and water cisterns<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>were not to be found east of Dupont Street and the insurance companies were not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>willing to gamble. It was reported in the Italian press that some 20,000 Italians lost<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>their homes in the conflagration.<span class=\"sup\">1</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>One of the priests from the church of Sts. Peter and Paul had managed to save the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>consecrated host, vestments, and holy vessels<span class=\"sup\">2</span> and said Mass under the inflamed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sky. After the fires had died, the Italians quietly returned to North Beach and tried to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>find the confidence to rebuild Little Italy.<span class=\"sup\">3</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Approximately five to six hundred Italians had definitely left San Francisco due<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to this tragic event, while over six thousand new immigrants arrived and helped<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the survivors clear the ruins. Seven hundred building permits were granted to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>North Beach Italian residents and businessmen<span class=\"sup\">4</span> to expedite the construction of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>Colony. Several real estate firms, such as the J. Cuneo Company in North Beach,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>demonstrated their confidence in the determination of the Italians by investing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>$400,000 in the reconstruction of apartments, stores, flats, and business offices.<span class=\"sup\">5</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Temporary buildings were cheaply erected for immediate occupancy, while the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>leaders of the Colony were busily engaged in drawing up plans for a modern Little<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>Italy. The buildings would be simple, small, neat, and airy, which combined both<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>functional and classical lines.<span class=\"sup\">6</span> One writer described this new architecture as a reflection<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the Italian immigrants' acceptance of American ways.<span class=\"sup\">7</span> The most picturesque<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>features of the flats and apartments were the roof-top sun decks with flower gardens.<span class=\"sup\">8</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Part of the planning for the new Colony included the renaming of two of the main<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>thoroughfares of the Italian Quarter. In 1907, one-half of Dupont Street was renamed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Grant Avenue, and by the end of 1908 all of Dupont became Grant Avenue. By 1910,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Montgomery Avenue was renamed Columbus Avenue and still retained its fame as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"The Avenue.\" The changes in these street names denoted a change in the geographic<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character of the Italian Quarter.<p><sup>1</sup>\"La Infernale Catastrofe de San Francisco,\" L'Italia, p. 1.

This time, however, the damage was far too extensive. The<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>tragedy was compounded by the great number of people and buildings which were<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>concentrated along the path of the fault.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The destruction caused by the earthquake and the ensuing fire in the Italian<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Quarter resulted in the complete loss of the district. The Italian Quarter, as other<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>parts of the city hit by the disaster, had been reduced to a knotted, tangled mass<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>of bent steel frames, charred bricks, and ashes. In North Beach, only a small part<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the community remained. The Italians on Telegraph Hill had been luckier than<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>most, although they suffered losses since insurance companies were not interested<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in insuring remote areas of the Hill. The scattered fire hydrants and water cisterns<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>were not to be found east of Dupont Street and the insurance companies were not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>willing to gamble.

San Francisco had been razed by fires six times from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>1849 to 1851, and each time the ruins had been swept away and the city rebuilt in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a much finer fashion. This time, however, the damage was far too extensive. The<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>tragedy was compounded by the great number of people and buildings which were<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>concentrated along the path of the fault.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The destruction caused by the earthquake and the ensuing fire in the Italian<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Quarter resulted in the complete loss of the district. The Italian Quarter, as other<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>parts of the city hit by the disaster, had been reduced to a knotted, tangled mass<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>of bent steel frames, charred bricks, and ashes. In North Beach, only a small part<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the community remained. The Italians on Telegraph Hill had been luckier than<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>most, although they suffered losses since insurance companies were not interested<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in insuring remote areas of the Hill. The scattered fire hydrants and water cisterns<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>were not to be found east of Dupont Street and the insurance companies were not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>willing to gamble. It was reported in the Italian press that some 20,000 Italians lost<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>their homes in the conflagration.<span class=\"sup\">1</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>One of the priests from the church of Sts. Peter and Paul had managed to save the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>consecrated host, vestments, and holy vessels<span class=\"sup\">2</span> and said Mass under the inflamed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sky. After the fires had died, the Italians quietly returned to North Beach and tried to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>find the confidence to rebuild Little Italy.<span class=\"sup\">3</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Approximately five to six hundred Italians had definitely left San Francisco due<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to this tragic event, while over six thousand new immigrants arrived and helped<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the survivors clear the ruins. Seven hundred building permits were granted to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>North Beach Italian residents and businessmen<span class=\"sup\">4</span> to expedite the construction of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>Colony. Several real estate firms, such as the J. Cuneo Company in North Beach,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>demonstrated their confidence in the determination of the Italians by investing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>$400,000 in the reconstruction of apartments, stores, flats, and business offices.<span class=\"sup\">5</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Temporary buildings were cheaply erected for immediate occupancy, while the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>leaders of the Colony were busily engaged in drawing up plans for a modern Little<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>Italy. The buildings would be simple, small, neat, and airy, which combined both<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>functional and classical lines.<span class=\"sup\">6</span> One writer described this new architecture as a reflection<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the Italian immigrants' acceptance of American ways.<span class=\"sup\">7</span> The most picturesque<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>features of the flats and apartments were the roof-top sun decks with flower gardens.<span class=\"sup\">8</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Part of the planning for the new Colony included the renaming of two of the main<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>thoroughfares of the Italian Quarter. In 1907, one-half of Dupont Street was renamed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Grant Avenue, and by the end of 1908 all of Dupont became Grant Avenue. By 1910,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Montgomery Avenue was renamed Columbus Avenue and still retained its fame as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"The Avenue.\" The changes in these street names denoted a change in the geographic<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character of the Italian Quarter.<p><sup>1</sup>\"La Infernale Catastrofe de San Francisco,\" L'Italia, p. 1.

In the discussion of its<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span></td><td>extent, its westward movement, etc., it cannot, therefore, any longer have a place in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the census reports.\" This brief official statement marks the closing of a great historic<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>movement. Up to our own day American history has been in a large degree the history<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span></td><td>American development.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Behind institutions, behind constitutional forms and modifications, lie the vital<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>forces that call these organs into life and shape them to meet changing conditions.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The peculiarity of American institutions is the fact that they have been compelled to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>adapt themselves to the changes of an expanding people-to the changes involved in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span></td><td>crossing a continent, in winning a wilderness, and in developing at each area of this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>progress out of the primitive economic and political conditions of the frontier into<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the complexity of city life. Said Calhoun in 1817, \"We are great, and rapidly-I was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about to say fearfully-growing!\" So saying, he touched the distinguishing feature of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>American life. All peoples show development; the germ theory of politics has been<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span></td><td>sufficiently emphasized. In the case of most nations, however, the development has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>occurred in a limited area; and if the nation has expanded, it has met other growing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>peoples whom it has conquered. But in the case of the United States we have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a different phenomenon. Limiting our attention to the Atlantic coast, we have the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>familiar phenomenon of the evolution of institutions in a limited area, such as the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span></td><td>rise of representative government in complex organs; the progress from primitive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>industrial society, without division of labor, up to manufacturing civilization. But<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>we have in addition to this a recurrence of the process of evolution in each western<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>area reached in the process of expansion. Thus American development has exhibited<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not merely advance along a single line, but a return to primitive conditions on a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span></td><td>continually advancing frontier line, and a new development for that area. American<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>social development has been continually beginning over again on the frontier. This<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the forces dominating the American character. The true point of view in the history<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span></td><td>of this nation is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West. Even the slavery struggle,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>which is made so exclusive an object of attention by writers like Professor von Holst,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>occupies its important place in American history because of its relation to westward<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>expansion.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>In this advance, the frontier is the outer edge of the wave-the meeting point<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span></td><td>between savagery and civilization. Much has been written about the frontier from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the point of view of border warfare and the chase, but as a field for the serious study<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the economist and the historian it has been neglected.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The American frontier is sharply distinguished from the European frontier-a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>fortified boundary line running through dense populations.

In our Western world in the eighteenth and nineteenth<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>centuries, this question used to be debated as an academic exercise. The spell of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well-being which our civilization was enjoying at the time had dazzled our grandfathers<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>into the quaint pharisaical notion that they were \"not as other men are\";<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>they had come to believe that our Western society was exempt from the possibility<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of falling into those mistakes and mishaps that have been the ruin of certain other<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>civilizations whose history, from the beginning to end, is an open book. To us, in our<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>generation, the old question has rather suddenly taken on a new and very practical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>significance. We have awakened to the truth (how, one wonders, could we ever have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>been blind to it?) that Western man and his works are no more invulnerable than the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>now extinct civilizations of the Aztecs and the Incas, the Sumerians and the Hittites.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>So today, with some anxiety, we are searching the scriptures of the past to find out<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whether they contain a lesson that we can decipher. Does history give us any information<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about our own prospects? And, if it does, what is the burden of it? Does it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>spell out for us an inexorable doom, which we can merely await with folded hands-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>resigning ourselves, as best we may, to a fate that we cannot avert or even modify by<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>our own efforts? Or does it inform us, not of certainties, but of probabilities, or bare<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>possibilities, in our own future? The practical difference is vast, for, on this second<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>alternative, so far from being stunned into passivity, we should be aroused to action.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>On this second alternative, the lesson of history would not be like an astrologer's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>horoscope; it would be like a navigator's chart, which affords the seafarer who has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the intelligence to use it a much greater hope of avoiding shipwreck than when he<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was sailing blind, because it gives him the means, if he has the skill and courage to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>use them, of steering a course between charted rocks and reefs.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">25</span>It will be seen that our question needs defining before we plunge into an attempt<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to answer it. When we ask ourselves, \"Does history repeat itself?\" do we mean no<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>more than, \"Does history turn out to have repeated itself, on occasions, in the past?\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Or are we asking whether history is governed by inviolable laws which have not only<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>taken effect in every past case to which they have applied, but are also bound to take<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>effect in every similar situation that may arise in the future? On this second interpretation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the word \"does\" would mean \"must\"; on the other interpretation it would<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mean \"may.\" On this issue, the writer of the present article may as well put his cards<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>on the table at once. He is not a determinist in his reading of the riddle of human<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>life. He believes that where there is life there is hope, and that, with God's help, man<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>is master of his own destiny, at least to some extent, in some respects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Which of the following most accurately describes the author's intent throughout the passage?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"240\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A.

The exercises and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>massages, the health motors and the skin foods-to what have they led? Are women<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>more beautiful than they were? Do they get something for the enormous expenditure<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>of energy, time, and money demanded of them by the beauty cult? These are<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>questions which it is difficult to answer. For the facts seem to contradict themselves.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The campaign for more physical beauty seems to be both a tremendous success and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a lamentable failure. It depends how you look at the results.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It is a success insofar as more women retain their youthful appearance to a greater<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>age than in the past. \"Old ladies\" are already becoming rare. In a few years, we may<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>well believe, they will be extinct. White hair and wrinkles, a bent back and hollow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cheeks will come to be regarded as medievally old-fashioned. The crone of the future<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>will be golden, curly, and cherry-lipped, neat-ankled and slender. The Portrait of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Artist's Mother will come to be almost indistinguishable, at future picture shows,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the Portrait of the Artist's Daughter. This desirable consummation will be due<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>in part to skin foods and injections of paraffin wax, facial surgery, mud baths, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>paint, in part to improved health, due in its turn to a more rational mode of life.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Ugliness is one of the symptoms of disease; beauty, of health. Insofar as the campaign<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for more beauty is also a campaign for more health, it is admirable and, up<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to a point, genuinely successful. Beauty that is merely the artificial shadow of these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>symptoms of health is intrinsically of poorer quality than the genuine article. Still,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is a sufficiently good imitation to be sometimes mistakable for the real thing. The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>apparatus for mimicking the symptoms of health is now within the reach of every<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>moderately prosperous person; the knowledge of the way in which real health can<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>be achieved is growing, and will in time, no doubt, be universally acted upon. When<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>that happy moment comes, will every woman be beautiful-as beautiful, at any rate,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as the natural shape of her features, with or without surgical and chemical aid, permits?<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The answer is emphatically: No. For real beauty is as much an affair of the inner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as of the outer self. The beauty of a porcelain jar is a matter of shape, of color, of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>surface texture. The jar may be empty or tenanted by spiders, full of honey or stinking<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>slime-it makes no difference to its beauty or ugliness. But a woman is alive, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>her beauty is therefore not skin deep. The surface of the human vessel is affected<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the nature of its spiritual contents. I have seen women who, by the standards of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a connoisseur of porcelain, were ravishingly lovely. Their shape, their color, their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>surface texture were perfect. And yet they were not beautiful.

These are<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>questions which it is difficult to answer.

It depends how you look at the results.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It is a success insofar as more women retain their youthful appearance to a greater<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>age than in the past. \"Old ladies\" are already becoming rare. In a few years, we may<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>well believe, they will be extinct. White hair and wrinkles, a bent back and hollow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cheeks will come to be regarded as medievally old-fashioned. The crone of the future<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>will be golden, curly, and cherry-lipped, neat-ankled and slender. The Portrait of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Artist's Mother will come to be almost indistinguishable, at future picture shows,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the Portrait of the Artist's Daughter. This desirable consummation will be due<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>in part to skin foods and injections of paraffin wax, facial surgery, mud baths, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>paint, in part to improved health, due in its turn to a more rational mode of life.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Ugliness is one of the symptoms of disease; beauty, of health. Insofar as the campaign<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for more beauty is also a campaign for more health, it is admirable and, up<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to a point, genuinely successful. Beauty that is merely the artificial shadow of these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>symptoms of health is intrinsically of poorer quality than the genuine article. Still,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is a sufficiently good imitation to be sometimes mistakable for the real thing. The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>apparatus for mimicking the symptoms of health is now within the reach of every<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>moderately prosperous person; the knowledge of the way in which real health can<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>be achieved is growing, and will in time, no doubt, be universally acted upon. When<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>that happy moment comes, will every woman be beautiful-as beautiful, at any rate,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as the natural shape of her features, with or without surgical and chemical aid, permits?<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The answer is emphatically: No. For real beauty is as much an affair of the inner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as of the outer self. The beauty of a porcelain jar is a matter of shape, of color, of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>surface texture. The jar may be empty or tenanted by spiders, full of honey or stinking<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>slime-it makes no difference to its beauty or ugliness. But a woman is alive, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>her beauty is therefore not skin deep. The surface of the human vessel is affected<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the nature of its spiritual contents. I have seen women who, by the standards of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a connoisseur of porcelain, were ravishingly lovely. Their shape, their color, their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>surface texture were perfect. And yet they were not beautiful. For the lovely vase was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>either empty or filled with some corruption. Spiritual emptiness or ugliness shows<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>through.

The exercises and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>massages, the health motors and the skin foods-to what have they led? Are women<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>more beautiful than they were? Do they get something for the enormous expenditure<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>of energy, time, and money demanded of them by the beauty cult? These are<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>questions which it is difficult to answer. For the facts seem to contradict themselves.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The campaign for more physical beauty seems to be both a tremendous success and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a lamentable failure. It depends how you look at the results.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It is a success insofar as more women retain their youthful appearance to a greater<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>age than in the past. \"Old ladies\" are already becoming rare. In a few years, we may<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>well believe, they will be extinct. White hair and wrinkles, a bent back and hollow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cheeks will come to be regarded as medievally old-fashioned. The crone of the future<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>will be golden, curly, and cherry-lipped, neat-ankled and slender. The Portrait of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Artist's Mother will come to be almost indistinguishable, at future picture shows,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the Portrait of the Artist's Daughter. This desirable consummation will be due<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>in part to skin foods and injections of paraffin wax, facial surgery, mud baths, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>paint, in part to improved health, due in its turn to a more rational mode of life.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Ugliness is one of the symptoms of disease; beauty, of health. Insofar as the campaign<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for more beauty is also a campaign for more health, it is admirable and, up<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to a point, genuinely successful. Beauty that is merely the artificial shadow of these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>symptoms of health is intrinsically of poorer quality than the genuine article. Still,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is a sufficiently good imitation to be sometimes mistakable for the real thing. The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>apparatus for mimicking the symptoms of health is now within the reach of every<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>moderately prosperous person; the knowledge of the way in which real health can<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>be achieved is growing, and will in time, no doubt, be universally acted upon. When<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>that happy moment comes, will every woman be beautiful-as beautiful, at any rate,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as the natural shape of her features, with or without surgical and chemical aid, permits?<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The answer is emphatically: No. For real beauty is as much an affair of the inner<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as of the outer self. The beauty of a porcelain jar is a matter of shape, of color, of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>surface texture. The jar may be empty or tenanted by spiders, full of honey or stinking<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>slime-it makes no difference to its beauty or ugliness. But a woman is alive, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>her beauty is therefore not skin deep. The surface of the human vessel is affected<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the nature of its spiritual contents. I have seen women who, by the standards of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a connoisseur of porcelain, were ravishingly lovely. Their shape, their color, their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>surface texture were perfect. And yet they were not beautiful. For the lovely vase was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>either empty or filled with some corruption. Spiritual emptiness or ugliness shows<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>through. And conversely, there is an interior light that can transfigure forms that the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>pure aesthetician would regard as imperfect or downright ugly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The principal contrast employed by the author of the passage is between</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"252\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. crones and fair ladies.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"252\" type=\"radio\" value=\"B\"/>B. inner beauty versus outer beauty.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"252\" type=\"radio\" value=\"C\"/>C. health and good looks.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"252\" type=\"radio\" value=\"D\"/>D. staying young and living longer.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"252\" type=\"radio\" value=\"E\"/>E. youth and age.</label></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"show-answer\" type=\"submit\">Show Answer</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"result\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">B</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"bold\">(B)</span> The first paragraph questions the efficacy of the \"modern cult of beauty.\" The second paragraph discusses women's techniques for making themselves beautiful.

He was Defiance Incarnate: he could not even meet<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>a Grand Duke and his court in the street without jamming his hat tight down on his<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>head and striding through the very middle of them. He had the manners of a disobliging<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>steamroller (most steamrollers are abjectly obliging and conciliatory); and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>he was rather less particular about his dress than a scarecrow: in fact he was once<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>arrested as a tramp because the police refused to believe that such a tatterdemalion<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>could be a famous composer, much less a temple of the most turbulent spirit that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>ever found expression in pure sound. It was indeed a mighty spirit; but if I had written<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the mightiest, which would mean mightier than the spirit of Handel, Beethoven<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>himself would have rebuked me; and what mortal man could pretend to a spirit<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mightier than Bach's? But that Beethoven's spirit was the most turbulent is beyond<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>all question. The impetuous fury of his strength, which he could quite easily contain<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and control, but often would not, and the unroariousness of his fun, go beyond anything<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the kind to be found in the works of other composers. Greenhorns write of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>syncopation now as if it were a new way of giving the utmost impetus to a musical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>measure; but the rowdiest jazz sounds like <i>The Maiden's Prayer</i> after Beethoven's<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>third <i>Leonora</i> overture; and certainly no jazz ensemble that I ever heard could<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>propel even the most eager dancer into action as the last movement of the <i>Seventh</i><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span><i>Symphony</i>. And no other composer has ever melted his hearers into complete sentimentality<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the tender beauty of his music, and then suddenly turned on them<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and mocked them with derisive trumpet blasts for being such fools. Nobody but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>Beethoven could govern Beethoven; and when, as happened when the fit was on<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>him, he deliberately refused to govern himself, he was ungovernable.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It was this turbulence, this deliberate disorder, this mockery, this reckless and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>triumphant disregard of conventional manners, that set Beethoven apart from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the musical geniuses of the ceremonious seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>He was a giant wave in that storm of the human spirit which produced the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Revolution. He called no man master. Mozart, his greatest predecessor in his own<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>department, had from his childhood been washed, combed, splendidly dressed,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and beautifully behaved in the presence of royal personages and peers. His childish<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>outburst at the Pompadour, \"Who is this woman who does not kiss me? The Queen<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>kisses me,\" would be incredible of Beethoven, who was still an unlicked cub even<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>when he had grown into a very grizzly bear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Which of the following best describes the rhetorical function of the second sentence of the passage (lines 4\u20136)?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"253\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A.

He was Defiance Incarnate: he could not even meet<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>a Grand Duke and his court in the street without jamming his hat tight down on his<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>head and striding through the very middle of them. He had the manners of a disobliging<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>steamroller (most steamrollers are abjectly obliging and conciliatory); and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>he was rather less particular about his dress than a scarecrow: in fact he was once<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>arrested as a tramp because the police refused to believe that such a tatterdemalion<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>could be a famous composer, much less a temple of the most turbulent spirit that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>ever found expression in pure sound. It was indeed a mighty spirit; but if I had written<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the mightiest, which would mean mightier than the spirit of Handel, Beethoven<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>himself would have rebuked me; and what mortal man could pretend to a spirit<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mightier than Bach's? But that Beethoven's spirit was the most turbulent is beyond<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>all question. The impetuous fury of his strength, which he could quite easily contain<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and control, but often would not, and the unroariousness of his fun, go beyond anything<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the kind to be found in the works of other composers. Greenhorns write of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>syncopation now as if it were a new way of giving the utmost impetus to a musical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>measure; but the rowdiest jazz sounds like <i>The Maiden's Prayer</i> after Beethoven's<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>third <i>Leonora</i> overture; and certainly no jazz ensemble that I ever heard could<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>propel even the most eager dancer into action as the last movement of the <i>Seventh</i><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span><i>Symphony</i>. And no other composer has ever melted his hearers into complete sentimentality<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the tender beauty of his music, and then suddenly turned on them<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and mocked them with derisive trumpet blasts for being such fools.

He was Defiance Incarnate: he could not even meet<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>a Grand Duke and his court in the street without jamming his hat tight down on his<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>head and striding through the very middle of them. He had the manners of a disobliging<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>steamroller (most steamrollers are abjectly obliging and conciliatory); and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>he was rather less particular about his dress than a scarecrow: in fact he was once<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>arrested as a tramp because the police refused to believe that such a tatterdemalion<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>could be a famous composer, much less a temple of the most turbulent spirit that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>ever found expression in pure sound. It was indeed a mighty spirit; but if I had written<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the mightiest, which would mean mightier than the spirit of Handel, Beethoven<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>himself would have rebuked me; and what mortal man could pretend to a spirit<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mightier than Bach's? But that Beethoven's spirit was the most turbulent is beyond<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>all question. The impetuous fury of his strength, which he could quite easily contain<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and control, but often would not, and the unroariousness of his fun, go beyond anything<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the kind to be found in the works of other composers. Greenhorns write of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>syncopation now as if it were a new way of giving the utmost impetus to a musical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>measure; but the rowdiest jazz sounds like <i>The Maiden's Prayer</i> after Beethoven's<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>third <i>Leonora</i> overture; and certainly no jazz ensemble that I ever heard could<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>propel even the most eager dancer into action as the last movement of the <i>Seventh</i><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span><i>Symphony</i>. And no other composer has ever melted his hearers into complete sentimentality<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the tender beauty of his music, and then suddenly turned on them<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and mocked them with derisive trumpet blasts for being such fools. Nobody but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>Beethoven could govern Beethoven; and when, as happened when the fit was on<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>him, he deliberately refused to govern himself, he was ungovernable.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It was this turbulence, this deliberate disorder, this mockery, this reckless and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>triumphant disregard of conventional manners, that set Beethoven apart from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the musical geniuses of the ceremonious seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>He was a giant wave in that storm of the human spirit which produced the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Revolution. He called no man master. Mozart, his greatest predecessor in his own<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>department, had from his childhood been washed, combed, splendidly dressed,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and beautifully behaved in the presence of royal personages and peers. His childish<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>outburst at the Pompadour, \"Who is this woman who does not kiss me? The Queen<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>kisses me,\" would be incredible of Beethoven, who was still an unlicked cub even<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>when he had grown into a very grizzly bear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Which of the following best states the subject of the passage?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"262\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A.

A physical giant, six feet<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>three inches tall, weighing almost three hundred pounds and dressed completely in<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>black, \"out of whose collar rose an enormous clean-shaven baby face like a Casaba<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>melon flowering from a fat black stalk, he was a subject for a Franz Hals, with long<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>white fingers that would have enraptured Memling.\"*<span class=\"sup\">1</span> Speaking in a slow drawl, he<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>delighted to drop cool pearls of sarcasm into the most heated rhetoric and to watch<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the resulting fizzle with the bland gravity of a New England Buddha. When a wordy<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>perennial, Representative Springer of Illinois, was declaiming to the House his passionate<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>preference to be right rather than President, the Speaker interjected, \"The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>gentleman need not be disturbed; he will never be either.\" When another member,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>notorious for ill-digested opinions and a halting manner, began some remarks with,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"I was thinking, Mr. Speaker, I was thinking . . .\" the Chair expressed the hope that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"no one will interrupt the gentleman's commendable innovation.\" Of two particularly<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>inept speakers, he remarked, \"They never open their mouths without subtracting<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the sum of human knowledge.\" It was said that he would rather make an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>epigram than a friend. Yet among the select who were his chosen friends he was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>known as \"one of the most genial souls that ever enlivened a company,\" whose conversation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"sparkling with good nature, was better than the best champagne.\" He<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>was Thomas B. Reed, Republican of Maine, aged fifty. Already acknowledged after<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>fourteen years in Congress as \"the ablest running debater the American people ever<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>saw,\" he would, before the end of the session, be called \"the greatest parliamentary<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>leader of his time, . . . far and away the most brilliant figure in American politics.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Although his roots went back to the beginning of New England, Reed was not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>nurtured for a political career by inherited wealth, social position or landed estate.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Politics in America made no use of these qualities, and men who possessed them<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>were not in politics. Well-to-do, long-established families did not shoulder-but<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>shunned-the responsibilities of government. Henry Adams' eldest brother, John,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"regarded as the most brilliant of the family and the most certain of high distinction,\"<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>who made a fortune in the Union Pacific Railroad, \"drew himself back\" from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>government, according to his brother. \"He had all he wanted; wealth, children,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>society, consideration; and he laughed at the idea of sacrificing himself in order to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>adorn a Cleveland Cabinet or get cheers from an Irish mob.\"<span class=\"sup\">2</span> This attitude was not<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>confined to the rather worn-out Adamses. When the young Theodore Roosevelt<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>announced his intention of entering politics in New York in 1880, he was laughed at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the \"men of cultivated and easy life\" who told him politics were \"low\" and run by<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"saloon-keepers, horse-car conductors and the like,\" whom he would find \"rough,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>brutal and unpleasant to deal with.\"<p><sup>*</sup> Hals: Dutch painter 1582\u20131666; Memling: Flemish painter of 15th century.

When a wordy<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>perennial, Representative Springer of Illinois, was declaiming to the House his passionate<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>preference to be right rather than President, the Speaker interjected, \"The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>gentleman need not be disturbed; he will never be either.\" When another member,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>notorious for ill-digested opinions and a halting manner, began some remarks with,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"I was thinking, Mr. Speaker, I was thinking . . .\" the Chair expressed the hope that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"no one will interrupt the gentleman's commendable innovation.\" Of two particularly<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>inept speakers, he remarked, \"They never open their mouths without subtracting<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the sum of human knowledge.\" It was said that he would rather make an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>epigram than a friend. Yet among the select who were his chosen friends he was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>known as \"one of the most genial souls that ever enlivened a company,\" whose conversation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"sparkling with good nature, was better than the best champagne.\" He<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>was Thomas B. Reed, Republican of Maine, aged fifty. Already acknowledged after<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>fourteen years in Congress as \"the ablest running debater the American people ever<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>saw,\" he would, before the end of the session, be called \"the greatest parliamentary<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>leader of his time, . . . far and away the most brilliant figure in American politics.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Although his roots went back to the beginning of New England, Reed was not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>nurtured for a political career by inherited wealth, social position or landed estate.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Politics in America made no use of these qualities, and men who possessed them<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>were not in politics. Well-to-do, long-established families did not shoulder-but<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>shunned-the responsibilities of government. Henry Adams' eldest brother, John,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"regarded as the most brilliant of the family and the most certain of high distinction,\"<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>who made a fortune in the Union Pacific Railroad, \"drew himself back\" from<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>government, according to his brother. \"He had all he wanted; wealth, children,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>society, consideration; and he laughed at the idea of sacrificing himself in order to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>adorn a Cleveland Cabinet or get cheers from an Irish mob.\"<span class=\"sup\">2</span> This attitude was not<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>confined to the rather worn-out Adamses. When the young Theodore Roosevelt<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>announced his intention of entering politics in New York in 1880, he was laughed at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by the \"men of cultivated and easy life\" who told him politics were \"low\" and run by<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>\"saloon-keepers, horse-car conductors and the like,\" whom he would find \"rough,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>brutal and unpleasant to deal with.\"<p><sup>*</sup> Hals: Dutch painter 1582\u20131666; Memling: Flemish painter of 15th century.

Everyone knows how delightful the dreams are that one<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dreams one's self, and how insipid the dreams of others are. I had an illustration of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>the fact, not many evenings ago, when a company of us got telling dreams. I had by<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>far the best dreams of any; to be quite frank, mine were the only dreams worth listening<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to; they were richly imaginative, delicately fantastic, exquisitely whimsical, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>humorous in the last degree; and I wondered that when the rest could have listened<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to them they were always eager to cut in with some silly, senseless, tasteless thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that made me sorry and ashamed for them. I shall not be going too far if I say that it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>was on their part the grossest betrayal of vanity that I ever witnessed.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>But the egotism of some people concerning their dreams is almost incredible.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They will come down to breakfast and bore everybody with a recital of the nonsense<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that has passed through their brains in sleep, as if they were not bad enough when<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>they were awake; they will not spare the slightest detail; and if, by the mercy of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>Heaven, they have forgotten something, they will be sure to recollect it, and go back<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and give it all over again with added circumstance. Such people do not reflect that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>there is something so purely and intensely personal in dreams that they can rarely<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>interest anyone but the dreamer, and that to the dearest friend, the closest relation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or connection, they can seldom be otherwise than tedious and impertinent. The<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>habit husbands and wives have of making each other listen to their dreams is especially<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cruel. They have each other quite helpless, and for this reason they should all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the more carefully guard themselves from abusing their advantage. Parents should<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not afflict their offspring with the rehearsal of their mental maunderings in sleep,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and children should learn that one of the first duties a child owes its parents is to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>spare them the anguish of hearing what it has dreamed about overnight. A like for-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>bearance in regard to the community at large should be taught in the first trait of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>good manners in public schools, if we ever come to teach good manners there.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Certain exceptional dreams, however, are so imperatively significant, so vitally<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>important, that it would be wrong to withhold them from the knowledge of those<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>who happened not to dream them, and I could scarcely forgive myself if I did not,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however briefly, impart them. It was only last week, for instance, that I found myself<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>one night in the company of the Duke of Wellington, the great Duke, the Iron one,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in fact; and after a few moments of agreeable conversation on topics of interest<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>among gentlemen, his Grace said that now, if I pleased, he would like a couple of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>those towels. We had not been speaking of towels, that I remember, but it seemed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the most natural thing in the world that he should mention them in the connection,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whatever it was, and I went at once to get them for him. At the place where they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>gave out towels, and where I found some very civil people, they told me that what I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted was not towels, and they gave me instead two bath-gowns, of rather scanty<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>measure, butternut in color, and Turkish in texture. The garments made somehow<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a very strong impression upon me, so that I could draw them now, if I could draw<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>anything, as they looked when they were held up to me. At the same moment, for no<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>reason that I can allege, I passed from a social to a menial relation to the Duke, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>foresaw that when I went back to him with those bath-gowns he would not thank me<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>as one gentleman to another, but would offer me a tip as if I were a servant. . . .<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>This seemed to end the whole affair, and I passed on to other visions, which I cannot<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>recall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the first paragraph, the primary

author.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>But it is mostly my own dreams I talk of, and that will somewhat excuse me for<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>talking of dreams at all. Everyone knows how delightful the dreams are that one<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dreams one's self, and how insipid the dreams of others are. I had an illustration of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>the fact, not many evenings ago, when a company of us got telling dreams. I had by<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>far the best dreams of any; to be quite frank, mine were the only dreams worth listening<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to; they were richly imaginative, delicately fantastic, exquisitely whimsical, and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>humorous in the last degree; and I wondered that when the rest could have listened<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to them they were always eager to cut in with some silly, senseless, tasteless thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that made me sorry and ashamed for them. I shall not be going too far if I say that it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>was on their part the grossest betrayal of vanity that I ever witnessed.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>But the egotism of some people concerning their dreams is almost incredible.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They will come down to breakfast and bore everybody with a recital of the nonsense<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that has passed through their brains in sleep, as if they were not bad enough when<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>they were awake; they will not spare the slightest detail; and if, by the mercy of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>Heaven, they have forgotten something, they will be sure to recollect it, and go back<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and give it all over again with added circumstance. Such people do not reflect that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>there is something so purely and intensely personal in dreams that they can rarely<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>interest anyone but the dreamer, and that to the dearest friend, the closest relation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or connection, they can seldom be otherwise than tedious and impertinent. The<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>habit husbands and wives have of making each other listen to their dreams is especially<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cruel. They have each other quite helpless, and for this reason they should all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the more carefully guard themselves from abusing their advantage. Parents should<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not afflict their offspring with the rehearsal of their mental maunderings in sleep,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and children should learn that one of the first duties a child owes its parents is to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>spare them the anguish of hearing what it has dreamed about overnight.

I have never taught anybody of any age how to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>enjoy, understand, appreciate poetry, or how to speak it. I have known a great many<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>poets, and innumerable people who wanted to be told that they were poets. I have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>done some teaching, but I have never \"taught poetry.\" My excuse for taking up this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>subject is of wholly different origin. I know that not only young people in colleges and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>universities, but secondary school children also, have to study, or at least acquaint<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>themselves with, poems by living poets; and I know that my poems are among those<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>studied. This fact brings some welcome supplement to my income; and it also brings<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>an increase in my correspondence, which is more or less welcome, though not all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the letters get answered. These are the letters from children themselves, or more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>precisely, the teenagers.

Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable.

I did study English at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>school, beginning, thank God, with grammar, and going on to \"rhetoric\"-for which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>also I am grateful. And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing.

Some of the juvenile correspondence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I receive seems to be instigated by the teachers, but the greater part does<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not. Indeed, some of my letters, I suspect, are inspired by a desire to score off the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>teacher in the hope of getting some statement from the horse's mouth which will be<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a direct contradiction of what has been taught. (I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon. I don't<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>believe that Tennyson and Browning, Longfellow and Whittier (to say nothing of Poe<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and Whitman, poets whose works we did not study) were embarrassed by juvenile<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>correspondence choking up their letter boxes.

I have never taught anybody of any age how to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>enjoy, understand, appreciate poetry, or how to speak it. I have known a great many<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>poets, and innumerable people who wanted to be told that they were poets. I have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>done some teaching, but I have never \"taught poetry.\" My excuse for taking up this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>subject is of wholly different origin. I know that not only young people in colleges and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>universities, but secondary school children also, have to study, or at least acquaint<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>themselves with, poems by living poets; and I know that my poems are among those<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>studied. This fact brings some welcome supplement to my income; and it also brings<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>an increase in my correspondence, which is more or less welcome, though not all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the letters get answered. These are the letters from children themselves, or more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>precisely, the teenagers. They live mostly in Britain, the United States, and Germany,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with a sprinkling from the nations of Asia. It is in a spirit of curiosity, therefore, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I approach the subject of teaching poetry: I should like to know more about these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>young people and about their teachers and the methods of teaching.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>For some of my young correspondents seem to be misguided. Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops.

Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops. Sometimes a photograph is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>asked for. Some young persons seem to want me to provide them with all the material<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>for a potted biography, including mention of my interests, tastes, and ways of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>amusing myself. Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable. Sometimes, but more rarely, they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>are avid for literary sources, which would seem to indicate that they have started too<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>early on the road to Xanadu.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Now, when I was young, this sort of thing did not happen. I did study English at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>school, beginning, thank God, with grammar, and going on to \"rhetoric\"-for which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>also I am grateful. And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing. But we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>never were made to read any literature which could be called \"contemporary.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>No. Not only were we not encouraged to take an interest in the poetry actually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>being written, but even had we been, I doubt whether we should have thought of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>entering into correspondence with the authors. Some of the juvenile correspondence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I receive seems to be instigated by the teachers, but the greater part does<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not.

(I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon.

It is in a spirit of curiosity, therefore, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I approach the subject of teaching poetry: I should like to know more about these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>young people and about their teachers and the methods of teaching.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>For some of my young correspondents seem to be misguided. Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops. Sometimes a photograph is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>asked for. Some young persons seem to want me to provide them with all the material<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>for a potted biography, including mention of my interests, tastes, and ways of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>amusing myself. Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable. Sometimes, but more rarely, they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>are avid for literary sources, which would seem to indicate that they have started too<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>early on the road to Xanadu.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Now, when I was young, this sort of thing did not happen. I did study English at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>school, beginning, thank God, with grammar, and going on to \"rhetoric\"-for which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>also I am grateful. And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing. But we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>never were made to read any literature which could be called \"contemporary.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>No. Not only were we not encouraged to take an interest in the poetry actually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>being written, but even had we been, I doubt whether we should have thought of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>entering into correspondence with the authors. Some of the juvenile correspondence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I receive seems to be instigated by the teachers, but the greater part does<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not. Indeed, some of my letters, I suspect, are inspired by a desire to score off the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>teacher in the hope of getting some statement from the horse's mouth which will be<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a direct contradiction of what has been taught. (I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon. I don't<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>believe that Tennyson and Browning, Longfellow and Whittier (to say nothing of Poe<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and Whitman, poets whose works we did not study) were embarrassed by juvenile<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>correspondence choking up their letter boxes.

Indeed, some of my letters, I suspect, are inspired by a desire to score off the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>teacher in the hope of getting some statement from the horse's mouth which will be<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a direct contradiction of what has been taught. (I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon. I don't<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>believe that Tennyson and Browning, Longfellow and Whittier (to say nothing of Poe<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and Whitman, poets whose works we did not study) were embarrassed by juvenile<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>correspondence choking up their letter boxes.

Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops. Sometimes a photograph is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>asked for. Some young persons seem to want me to provide them with all the material<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>for a potted biography, including mention of my interests, tastes, and ways of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>amusing myself. Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable. Sometimes, but more rarely, they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>are avid for literary sources, which would seem to indicate that they have started too<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>early on the road to Xanadu.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Now, when I was young, this sort of thing did not happen. I did study English at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>school, beginning, thank God, with grammar, and going on to \"rhetoric\"-for which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>also I am grateful. And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing. But we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>never were made to read any literature which could be called \"contemporary.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>No. Not only were we not encouraged to take an interest in the poetry actually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>being written, but even had we been, I doubt whether we should have thought of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>entering into correspondence with the authors.

Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable.

And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing. But we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>never were made to read any literature which could be called \"contemporary.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>No. Not only were we not encouraged to take an interest in the poetry actually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>being written, but even had we been, I doubt whether we should have thought of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>entering into correspondence with the authors. Some of the juvenile correspondence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I receive seems to be instigated by the teachers, but the greater part does<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not. Indeed, some of my letters, I suspect, are inspired by a desire to score off the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>teacher in the hope of getting some statement from the horse's mouth which will be<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a direct contradiction of what has been taught. (I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon. I don't<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>believe that Tennyson and Browning, Longfellow and Whittier (to say nothing of Poe<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and Whitman, poets whose works we did not study) were embarrassed by juvenile<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>correspondence choking up their letter boxes.

poet.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>I hold no diploma, certificate, or other academic document to show that I am<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>qualified to discuss this subject. I have never taught anybody of any age how to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>enjoy, understand, appreciate poetry, or how to speak it. I have known a great many<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>poets, and innumerable people who wanted to be told that they were poets. I have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>done some teaching, but I have never \"taught poetry.\" My excuse for taking up this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>subject is of wholly different origin. I know that not only young people in colleges and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>universities, but secondary school children also, have to study, or at least acquaint<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>themselves with, poems by living poets; and I know that my poems are among those<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>studied. This fact brings some welcome supplement to my income; and it also brings<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>an increase in my correspondence, which is more or less welcome, though not all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the letters get answered. These are the letters from children themselves, or more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>precisely, the teenagers. They live mostly in Britain, the United States, and Germany,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with a sprinkling from the nations of Asia. It is in a spirit of curiosity, therefore, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I approach the subject of teaching poetry: I should like to know more about these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>young people and about their teachers and the methods of teaching.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>For some of my young correspondents seem to be misguided. Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops. Sometimes a photograph is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>asked for. Some young persons seem to want me to provide them with all the material<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>for a potted biography, including mention of my interests, tastes, and ways of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>amusing myself. Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable.

It is in a spirit of curiosity, therefore, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I approach the subject of teaching poetry: I should like to know more about these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>young people and about their teachers and the methods of teaching.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>For some of my young correspondents seem to be misguided. Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops. Sometimes a photograph is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>asked for. Some young persons seem to want me to provide them with all the material<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>for a potted biography, including mention of my interests, tastes, and ways of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>amusing myself. Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable. Sometimes, but more rarely, they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>are avid for literary sources, which would seem to indicate that they have started too<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>early on the road to Xanadu.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Now, when I was young, this sort of thing did not happen. I did study English at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>school, beginning, thank God, with grammar, and going on to \"rhetoric\"-for which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>also I am grateful. And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing. But we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>never were made to read any literature which could be called \"contemporary.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>No. Not only were we not encouraged to take an interest in the poetry actually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>being written, but even had we been, I doubt whether we should have thought of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>entering into correspondence with the authors. Some of the juvenile correspondence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I receive seems to be instigated by the teachers, but the greater part does<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not. Indeed, some of my letters, I suspect, are inspired by a desire to score off the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>teacher in the hope of getting some statement from the horse's mouth which will be<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a direct contradiction of what has been taught. (I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon. I don't<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>believe that Tennyson and Browning, Longfellow and Whittier (to say nothing of Poe<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and Whitman, poets whose works we did not study) were embarrassed by juvenile<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>correspondence choking up their letter boxes. The teaching of the contemporary<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>literature, the introduction of the young to poetry by living poets, is something that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>came about in my time without my being aware of what was happening.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In context, the expression \"to score off\" (line 42) is best interpreted to mean which of the following?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"294\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A.

I have never taught anybody of any age how to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>enjoy, understand, appreciate poetry, or how to speak it. I have known a great many<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>poets, and innumerable people who wanted to be told that they were poets. I have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>done some teaching, but I have never \"taught poetry.\" My excuse for taking up this<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>subject is of wholly different origin. I know that not only young people in colleges and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>universities, but secondary school children also, have to study, or at least acquaint<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>themselves with, poems by living poets; and I know that my poems are among those<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>studied. This fact brings some welcome supplement to my income; and it also brings<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>an increase in my correspondence, which is more or less welcome, though not all<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the letters get answered. These are the letters from children themselves, or more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>precisely, the teenagers. They live mostly in Britain, the United States, and Germany,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>with a sprinkling from the nations of Asia. It is in a spirit of curiosity, therefore, that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I approach the subject of teaching poetry: I should like to know more about these<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>young people and about their teachers and the methods of teaching.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>For some of my young correspondents seem to be misguided. Sometimes I have<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>been assigned to them as a \"project,\" more often they have made the choice themselves-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>it is not always clear why. (There was one case, that of an Egyptian boy, who<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wanted to write a thesis about my work, and as none of my work was locally available<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and as he wanted to read it, asked me to send him all my books. That was very exceptional,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>however.) Very often the writers ask for information about myself, sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the form of a questionnaire. I remember being asked by one child whether it was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>true that I only cared to associate with lords and bishops. Sometimes a photograph is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>asked for. Some young persons seem to want me to provide them with all the material<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>for a potted biography, including mention of my interests, tastes, and ways of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>amusing myself. Are these children studying poetry, or merely studying poets? Very<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>often they want explanations, either of a whole poem (\"what does it mean\") or of a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>particular line or phrase; and the kind of question they ask often suggests that their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>approach to that poem has been wrong, for they want the wrong kind of explanation,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>or ask questions which are simply unanswerable. Sometimes, but more rarely, they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>are avid for literary sources, which would seem to indicate that they have started too<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>early on the road to Xanadu.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Now, when I was young, this sort of thing did not happen. I did study English at<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>school, beginning, thank God, with grammar, and going on to \"rhetoric\"-for which<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>also I am grateful. And we had to read a number of set books of prose and verse-<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mostly in school editions which made them look peculiarly unappetizing. But we<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>never were made to read any literature which could be called \"contemporary.\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>No. Not only were we not encouraged to take an interest in the poetry actually<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>being written, but even had we been, I doubt whether we should have thought of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>entering into correspondence with the authors. Some of the juvenile correspondence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I receive seems to be instigated by the teachers, but the greater part does<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>not. Indeed, some of my letters, I suspect, are inspired by a desire to score off the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>teacher in the hope of getting some statement from the horse's mouth which will be<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a direct contradiction of what has been taught. (I confess that this last type of letter<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>is one which I sometimes take pleasure in answering-when the teacher seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to have been wrong.) But my point is that this pressure upon the poet from young<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>people who have been compelled to read his work is a modern phenomenon. I don't<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>believe that Tennyson and Browning, Longfellow and Whittier (to say nothing of Poe<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and Whitman, poets whose works we did not study) were embarrassed by juvenile<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>correspondence choking up their letter boxes. The teaching of the contemporary<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>literature, the introduction of the young to poetry by living poets, is something that<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>came about in my time without my being aware of what was happening.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The speaker's tone in the passage as a whole can best be described as</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input

class=\"italic\">The passage below comes from the pen of a well-know</span><span class=\"italic\">n</span> <span class=\"italic\">19th-century writer.</span></p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The changes wrought by death are in themselves so sharp and final, and so terrible<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and melancholy in their consequences, that the thing stands alone in man's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>experience, and has no parallel upon earth. It outdoes all other accidents because<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>it is the last of them. Sometimes it leaps suddenly upon its victims, like a Thug;<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>sometimes it lays a regular siege and creeps upon their citadel during a score of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>years. And when the business is done, there is sore havoc made in other people's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lives, and a pin knocked out by which many subsidiary friendships hung together.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are empty chairs, solitary walks, and single beds at night. Again, in taking away<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>our friends, death does not take them away utterly, but leaves behind a mocking,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>tragical, and soon intolerable residue, which must be hurriedly concealed. Hence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a whole chapter of sights and customs striking to the mind, from the pyramids of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Egypt to the gallows and hanging trees of medieval Europe. The poorest persons<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have a bit of pageant going towards the tomb; memorial stones are set up over the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>least memorable; and, in order to preserve some show of respect for what remains<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>of our old loves and friendships, we must accompany it with much grimly ludicrous<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>ceremonial, and the hired undertaker parades before the door.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Although few things are spoken of with more fearful whisperings than this prospect<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of death, few have less influence on conduct under healthy circumstances.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>We have all heard of cities in South America built upon the side of fiery mountains,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and how, in this tremendous neighbourhood, the inhabitants are not a jot more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>impressed by the solemnity of mortal conditions than if they were delving* gardens<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the greenest corner of England. There are serenades and suppers and much gallantry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>among the myrtles overhead; and meanwhile the foundation shudders underfoot,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the bowels of the mountain growl, and at any moment living ruin may leap<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>sky-high into the moonlight, and tumble man and his merry-making in the dust. In<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the eyes of very young people, and very dull old ones, there is something indescribably<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>reckless and desperate in such a picture. It seems not credible that respectable<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>married people, with umbrellas, should find appetite for a bit of supper within quite<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a long distance of a fiery mountain; ordinary life begins to smell of high-handed<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>debauch when it is carried on so close to a catastrophe; and even cheese and salad, it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>seems, could hardly be relished in such circumstances without something like defiance<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the Creator. It should be a place for nobody but hermits dwelling in prayer<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and maceration, or mere born-devils drowning care in perpetual carouse.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>And yet, when one comes to think upon it calmly, the situation of these South<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>American citizens forms only a very pale figure for the state of ordinary mankind.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>This world itself, travelling blindly and swiftly in overcrowded space, among a million<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions, may very well<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>come by a knock that would set it into explosions like a penny squib.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> And what,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>pathologically looked at, is the human body with all its organs, but a mere bagful<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>of petards?<span class=\"sup\">2</span> The least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>powder-magazine to the ship; and with every breath we breathe, and every meal<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>we eat, we are putting one or more of them in peril.

It should be a place for nobody but hermits dwelling in prayer<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and maceration, or mere born-devils drowning care in perpetual carouse.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>And yet, when one comes to think upon it calmly, the situation of these South<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>American citizens forms only a very pale figure for the state of ordinary mankind.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>This world itself, travelling blindly and swiftly in overcrowded space, among a million<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions, may very well<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>come by a knock that would set it into explosions like a penny squib.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> And what,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>pathologically looked at, is the human body with all its organs, but a mere bagful<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>of petards?<span class=\"sup\">2</span> The least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>powder-magazine to the ship; and with every breath we breathe, and every meal<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>we eat, we are putting one or more of them in peril. Think with what a preparation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinner table: a deadlier spot than<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>any battlefield in history, where the far greater proportion of our ancestors have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>left their bones! What woman would ever be lured into marriage, so much more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dangerous than the wildest sea? And what would it be to grow old? For, after a certain<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>distance, every step we take in life we find the ice growing thinner below our<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>feet, and all around us and behind us we

It outdoes all other accidents because<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>it is the last of them. Sometimes it leaps suddenly upon its victims, like a Thug;<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>sometimes it lays a regular siege and creeps upon their citadel during a score of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>years. And when the business is done, there is sore havoc made in other people's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lives, and a pin knocked out by which many subsidiary friendships hung together.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are empty chairs, solitary walks, and single beds at night. Again, in taking away<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>our friends, death does not take them away utterly, but leaves behind a mocking,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>tragical, and soon intolerable residue, which must be hurriedly concealed. Hence<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a whole chapter of sights and customs striking to the mind, from the pyramids of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Egypt to the gallows and hanging trees of medieval Europe. The poorest persons<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have a bit of pageant going towards the tomb; memorial stones are set up over the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>least memorable; and, in order to preserve some show of respect for what remains<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>of our old loves and friendships, we must accompany it with much grimly ludicrous<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>ceremonial, and the hired undertaker parades before the door.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Although few things are spoken of with more fearful whisperings than this prospect<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of death, few have less influence on conduct under healthy circumstances.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>We have all heard of cities in South America built upon the side of fiery mountains,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>and how, in this tremendous neighbourhood, the inhabitants are not a jot more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>impressed by the solemnity of mortal conditions than if they were delving* gardens<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in the greenest corner of England. There are serenades and suppers and much gallantry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>among the myrtles overhead; and meanwhile the foundation shudders underfoot,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the bowels of the mountain growl, and at any moment living ruin may leap<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>sky-high into the moonlight, and tumble man and his merry-making in the dust. In<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the eyes of very young people, and very dull old ones, there is something indescribably<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>reckless and desperate in such a picture. It seems not credible that respectable<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>married people, with umbrellas, should find appetite for a bit of supper within quite<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a long distance of a fiery mountain; ordinary life begins to smell of high-handed<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>debauch when it is carried on so close to a catastrophe; and even cheese and salad, it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>seems, could hardly be relished in such circumstances without something like defiance<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of the Creator. It should be a place for nobody but hermits dwelling in prayer<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and maceration, or mere born-devils drowning care in perpetual carouse.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>And yet, when one comes to think upon it calmly, the situation of these South<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>American citizens forms only a very pale figure for the state of ordinary mankind.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>This world itself, travelling blindly and swiftly in overcrowded space, among a million<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>other worlds travelling blindly and swiftly in contrary directions, may very well<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>come by a knock that would set it into explosions like a penny squib.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> And what,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>pathologically looked at, is the human body with all its organs, but a mere bagful<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>of petards?<span class=\"sup\">2</span> The least of these is as dangerous to the whole economy as the ship's<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>powder-magazine to the ship; and with every breath we breathe, and every meal<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>we eat, we are putting one or more of them in peril. Think with what a preparation<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of spirit we should affront the daily peril of the dinner table: a deadlier spot than<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>any battlefield in history, where the far greater proportion of our ancestors have<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>left their bones!

Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from a group of local Indians for sixty guilders worth of goods, or as the nineteenthcentury<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>historian Edmund O'Callaghan calculated it, twenty-four dollars. From the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>seventeenth through the early twentieth century thousands of real estate transactions<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>occurred in which native Americans sold parcels-ranging in size from a town<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lot to a midwestern state-to English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>settlers. But only one sale is legend; only one is known by everyone. Only one has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had the durability to be riffed on in Broadway song (\"Give It Back to the Indians,\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the 1939 Rodgers and Hart musical Too Many Girls), and, at the end of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>twentieth century, to do service as a punchline in a column by humorist Dave Barry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(\". . . which the Dutch settler Peter Minuit purchased from the Manhattan Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for $24, plus $167,000 a month in maintenance fees\").<span class=\"sup\">2</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It's pretty clear why this particular sale lodged in the cultural memory, why it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>became legend: the extreme incongruity, the exquisitely absurd price. It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives.

class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>The passage below is an excerpt from a contemporary book.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So he bought it.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> Everyone knows that. Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from a group of local Indians for sixty guilders worth of goods, or as the nineteenthcentury<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>historian Edmund O'Callaghan calculated it, twenty-four dollars. From the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>seventeenth through the early twentieth century thousands of real estate transactions<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>occurred in which native Americans sold parcels-ranging in size from a town<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lot to a midwestern state-to English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>settlers. But only one sale is legend; only one is known by everyone. Only one has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had the durability to be riffed on in Broadway song (\"Give It Back to the Indians,\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the 1939 Rodgers and Hart musical Too Many Girls), and, at the end of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>twentieth century, to do service as a punchline in a column by humorist Dave Barry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(\". . . which the Dutch settler Peter Minuit purchased from the Manhattan Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for $24, plus $167,000 a month in maintenance fees\").<span class=\"sup\">2</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It's pretty clear why this particular sale lodged in the cultural memory, why it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>became legend: the extreme incongruity, the exquisitely absurd price. It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives. It's a neatly packed symbol of the entire<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>conquest of the continent that was to come.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Beyond that, the purchase snippet is notable because it is virtually the only thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about Manhattan colony that has become part of history.

class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>The passage below is an excerpt from a contemporary book.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So he bought it.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> Everyone knows that. Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from a group of local Indians for sixty guilders worth of goods, or as the nineteenthcentury<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>historian Edmund O'Callaghan calculated it, twenty-four dollars. From the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>seventeenth through the early twentieth century thousands of real estate transactions<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>occurred in which native Americans sold parcels-ranging in size from a town<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lot to a midwestern state-to English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>settlers. But only one sale is legend; only one is known by everyone. Only one has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had the durability to be riffed on in Broadway song (\"Give It Back to the Indians,\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the 1939 Rodgers and Hart musical Too Many Girls), and, at the end of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>twentieth century, to do service as a punchline in a column by humorist Dave Barry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(\". . . which the Dutch settler Peter Minuit purchased from the Manhattan Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for $24, plus $167,000 a month in maintenance fees\").<span class=\"sup\">2</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It's pretty clear why this particular sale lodged in the cultural memory, why it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>became legend: the extreme incongruity, the exquisitely absurd price. It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives. It's a neatly packed symbol of the entire<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>conquest of the continent that was to come.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Beyond that, the purchase snippet is notable because it is virtually the only thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about Manhattan colony that has become part of history. For this reason, too, it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>deserves exploring.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So, who were the Indians who agreed to this transaction, and what did they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>think it meant? The ancestors of the people whom European settlers took to calling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Indians (after Columbus, who at first thought he had arrived at the outer reaches of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>India) traveled the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska that existed during the last ice<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>age, more than twelve thousand years ago, then spread slowly through the Americas.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They came from Asia; their genetic makeup is a close match with Siberians and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Mongolians.<span class=\"sup\">3</span> They spread out thinly across the incomprehensible vastness of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>American continents to create a linguistic richness unparalleled in human history: it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>has been estimated that at the moment Columbus arrived in the New World twentyfive<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>percent of all human languages were North American Indian.<span class=\"sup\">4</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are two rival, hardened stereotypes that get in the way of understanding<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>these people: the one that arose from the long cultural dismissing of American Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as \"primitive,\" and the modern dogma that sees them as Noble and Defenseless.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Both are cartoon images. Recent work in genetics, archaeology, anthropology,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>and linguistics makes plain what should be obvious: that the Mohican, Mohawk,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Lenape, Montauk, Housatonic, and other peoples occupying the lands that for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>time were called New Netherland, as well as the Massachusett, Wampanoag, Sokoki,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Pennacook, Abenaki, Oneida, Onondaga, Susquehannock, Nanticoke, and others<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who inhabited other parts of what became the states of New York, Massachusetts,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Delaware, Maryland,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and New Jersey, were biologically, genetically, intellectually, all but identical to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Dutch, English, French, Swedish, and others who came in contact with them in the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>beginning of the seventeenth century. The Indians were as skilled, as duplicitous, as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>capable of theological rumination and technological cunning, as smart and as pigheaded,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>and as curious and cruel as the Europeans who met them. The members of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the Manhattan-based colony who knew them-who spent time among them in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>villages, hunted and traded with them, learned their languages-knew this perfectly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well. It was later, after the two had separated into rival camps, that the stereotypes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>set. The early seventeenth century was a much more interesting time than the Wild<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>West era, a time when Indians and Europeans were something like equal participants,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dealing with one another as allies, competitors, partners.<p><sup>1</sup> The order of events is far from clear, and historians debate whether Verhulst or Minuit was the one who purchased Manhattan Island.

passage below is an excerpt from a contemporary book.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So he bought it.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> Everyone knows that. Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from a group of local Indians for sixty guilders worth of goods, or as the nineteenthcentury<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>historian Edmund O'Callaghan calculated it, twenty-four dollars. From the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>seventeenth through the early twentieth century thousands of real estate transactions<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>occurred in which native Americans sold parcels-ranging in size from a town<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lot to a midwestern state-to English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>settlers. But only one sale is legend; only one is known by everyone. Only one has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had the durability to be riffed on in Broadway song (\"Give It Back to the Indians,\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the 1939 Rodgers and Hart musical Too Many Girls), and, at the end of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>twentieth century, to do service as a punchline in a column by humorist Dave Barry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(\". . . which the Dutch settler Peter Minuit purchased from the Manhattan Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for $24, plus $167,000 a month in maintenance fees\").<span class=\"sup\">2</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It's pretty clear why this particular sale lodged in the cultural memory, why it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>became legend: the extreme incongruity, the exquisitely absurd price. It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives. It's a neatly packed symbol of the entire<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>conquest of the continent that was to come.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Beyond that, the purchase snippet is notable because it is virtually the only thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about Manhattan colony that has become part of history. For this reason, too, it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>deserves exploring.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So, who were the Indians who agreed to this transaction, and what did they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>think it meant? The ancestors of the people whom European settlers took to calling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Indians (after Columbus, who at first thought he had arrived at the outer reaches of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>India) traveled the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska that existed during the last ice<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>age, more than twelve thousand years ago, then spread slowly through the Americas.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They came from Asia; their genetic makeup is a close match with Siberians and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Mongolians.<span class=\"sup\">3</span> They spread out thinly across the incomprehensible vastness of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>American continents to create a linguistic richness unparalleled in human history: it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>has been estimated that at the moment Columbus arrived in the New World twentyfive<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>percent of all human languages were North American Indian.<span class=\"sup\">4</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are two rival, hardened stereotypes that get in the way of understanding<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>these people: the one that arose from the long cultural dismissing of American Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as \"primitive,\" and the modern dogma that sees them as Noble and Defenseless.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Both are cartoon images. Recent work in genetics, archaeology, anthropology,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>and linguistics makes plain what should be obvious: that the Mohican, Mohawk,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Lenape, Montauk, Housatonic, and other peoples occupying the lands that for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>time were called New Netherland, as well as the Massachusett, Wampanoag, Sokoki,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Pennacook, Abenaki, Oneida, Onondaga, Susquehannock, Nanticoke, and others<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who inhabited other parts of what became the states of New York, Massachusetts,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Delaware, Maryland,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and New Jersey, were biologically, genetically, intellectually, all but identical to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Dutch, English, French, Swedish, and others who came in contact with them in the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>beginning of the seventeenth century. The Indians were as skilled, as duplicitous, as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>capable of theological rumination and technological cunning, as smart and as pigheaded,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>and as curious and cruel as the Europeans who met them. The members of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the Manhattan-based colony who knew them-who spent time among them in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>villages, hunted and traded with them, learned their languages-knew this perfectly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well. It was later, after the two had separated into rival camps, that the stereotypes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>set. The early seventeenth century was a much more interesting time than the Wild<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>West era, a time when Indians and Europeans were something like equal participants,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dealing with one another as allies, competitors, partners.<p><sup>1</sup> The order of events is far from clear, and historians debate whether Verhulst or Minuit was the one who purchased Manhattan Island. My account is based on my own reading of all relevant primary source material, as well as arguments made by various historians. I side against those who in recent decades removed Minuit from his legendary position as purchaser of the island, and with those who reassign him to that position . . . .</p><p><sup>2</sup> Dave

It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives. It's a neatly packed symbol of the entire<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>conquest of the continent that was to come.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Beyond that, the purchase snippet is notable because it is virtually the only thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about Manhattan colony that has become part of history. For this reason, too, it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>deserves exploring.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So, who were the Indians who agreed to this transaction, and what did they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>think it meant? The ancestors of the people whom European settlers took to calling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Indians (after Columbus, who at first thought he had arrived at the outer reaches of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>India) traveled the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska that existed during the last ice<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>age, more than twelve thousand years ago, then spread slowly through the Americas.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They came from Asia; their genetic makeup is a close match with Siberians and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Mongolians.<span class=\"sup\">3</span> They spread out thinly across the incomprehensible vastness of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>American continents to create a linguistic richness unparalleled in human history: it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>has been estimated that at the moment Columbus arrived in the New World twentyfive<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>percent of all human languages were North American Indian.<span class=\"sup\">4</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are two rival, hardened stereotypes that get in the way of understanding<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>these people: the one that arose from the long cultural dismissing of American Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as \"primitive,\" and the modern dogma that sees them as Noble and Defenseless.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Both are cartoon images. Recent work in genetics, archaeology, anthropology,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>and linguistics makes plain what should be obvious: that the Mohican, Mohawk,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Lenape, Montauk, Housatonic, and other peoples occupying the lands that for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>time were called New Netherland, as well as the Massachusett, Wampanoag, Sokoki,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Pennacook, Abenaki, Oneida, Onondaga, Susquehannock, Nanticoke, and others<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who inhabited other parts of what became the states of New York, Massachusetts,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Delaware, Maryland,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and New Jersey, were biologically, genetically, intellectually, all but identical to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Dutch, English, French, Swedish, and others who came in contact with them in the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>beginning of the seventeenth century. The Indians were as skilled, as duplicitous, as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>capable of theological rumination and technological cunning, as smart and as pigheaded,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>and as curious and cruel as the Europeans who met them. The members of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the Manhattan-based colony who knew them-who spent time among them in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>villages, hunted and traded with them, learned their languages-knew this perfectly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well. It was later, after the two had separated into rival camps, that the stereotypes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>set.

The Indians were as skilled, as duplicitous, as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>capable of theological rumination and technological cunning, as smart and as pigheaded,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>and as curious and cruel as the Europeans who met them. The members of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the Manhattan-based colony who knew them-who spent time among them in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>villages, hunted and traded with them, learned their languages-knew this perfectly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well.

The ancestors of the people whom European settlers took to calling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Indians (after Columbus, who at first thought he had arrived at the outer reaches of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>India) traveled the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska that existed during the last ice<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>age, more than twelve thousand years ago, then spread slowly through the Americas.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They came from Asia; their genetic makeup is a close match with Siberians and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Mongolians.<span class=\"sup\">3</span> They spread out thinly across the incomprehensible vastness of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>American continents to create a linguistic richness unparalleled in human history: it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>has been estimated that at the moment Columbus arrived in the New World twentyfive<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>percent of all human languages were North American Indian.<span class=\"sup\">4</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are two rival, hardened stereotypes that get in the way of understanding<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>these people: the one that arose from the long cultural dismissing of American Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as \"primitive,\" and the modern dogma that sees them as Noble and Defenseless.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Both are cartoon images. Recent work in genetics, archaeology, anthropology,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>and linguistics makes plain what should be obvious: that the Mohican, Mohawk,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Lenape, Montauk, Housatonic, and other peoples occupying the lands that for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>time were called New Netherland, as well as the Massachusett, Wampanoag, Sokoki,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Pennacook, Abenaki, Oneida, Onondaga, Susquehannock, Nanticoke, and others<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who inhabited other parts of what became the states of New York, Massachusetts,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Delaware, Maryland,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and New Jersey, were biologically, genetically, intellectually, all but identical to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Dutch, English, French, Swedish, and others who came in contact with them in the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>beginning of the seventeenth century. The Indians were as skilled, as duplicitous, as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>capable of theological rumination and technological cunning, as smart and as pigheaded,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>and as curious and cruel as the Europeans who met them. The members of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the Manhattan-based colony who knew them-who spent time among them in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>villages, hunted and traded with them, learned their languages-knew this perfectly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well. It was later, after the two had separated into rival camps, that the stereotypes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>set. The early seventeenth century was a much more interesting time than the Wild<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>West era, a time when Indians and Europeans were something like equal participants,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dealing with one another as allies, competitors, partners.<p><sup>1</sup> The order of events is far from clear, and historians debate whether Verhulst or Minuit was the one who purchased Manhattan Island. My account is based on my own reading of all relevant primary source material, as well as arguments made by various historians. I side against those who in recent decades removed Minuit from his legendary position as purchaser of the island, and with those who reassign him to that position . . . .</p><p><sup>2</sup> Dave

Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from a group of local Indians for sixty guilders worth of goods, or as the nineteenthcentury<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>historian Edmund O'Callaghan calculated it, twenty-four dollars. From the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>seventeenth through the early twentieth century thousands of real estate transactions<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>occurred in which native Americans sold parcels-ranging in size from a town<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lot to a midwestern state-to English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>settlers. But only one sale is legend; only one is known by everyone. Only one has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had the durability to be riffed on in Broadway song (\"Give It Back to the Indians,\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the 1939 Rodgers and Hart musical Too Many Girls), and, at the end of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>twentieth century, to do service as a punchline in a column by humorist Dave Barry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(\". . . which the Dutch settler Peter Minuit purchased from the Manhattan Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for $24, plus $167,000 a month in maintenance fees\").<span class=\"sup\">2</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It's pretty clear why this particular sale lodged in the cultural memory, why it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>became legend: the extreme incongruity, the exquisitely absurd price. It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives. It's a neatly packed symbol of the entire<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>conquest of the continent that was to come.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Beyond that, the purchase snippet is notable because it is virtually the only thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about Manhattan colony that has become part of history.

book.</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So he bought it.<span class=\"sup\">1</span> Everyone knows that. Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan Island<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from a group of local Indians for sixty guilders worth of goods, or as the nineteenthcentury<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>historian Edmund O'Callaghan calculated it, twenty-four dollars. From the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>seventeenth through the early twentieth century thousands of real estate transactions<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>occurred in which native Americans sold parcels-ranging in size from a town<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lot to a midwestern state-to English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and other European<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>settlers. But only one sale is legend; only one is known by everyone. Only one has<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>had the durability to be riffed on in Broadway song (\"Give It Back to the Indians,\"<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>from the 1939 Rodgers and Hart musical Too Many Girls), and, at the end of the<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>twentieth century, to do service as a punchline in a column by humorist Dave Barry<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(\". . . which the Dutch settler Peter Minuit purchased from the Manhattan Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for $24, plus $167,000 a month in maintenance fees\").<span class=\"sup\">2</span><br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>It's pretty clear why this particular sale lodged in the cultural memory, why it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>became legend: the extreme incongruity, the exquisitely absurd price. It is the most<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>dramatic illustration of the whole long process of stripping the natives of their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>land. The idea that the center of world commerce, an island packed with trillions of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dollars' worth of real estate, was once bought from supposedly hapless Stone Age<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>innocents for twenty-four dollars' worth of household goods is too delicious to let<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>slip. It speaks to our sense of early American history as the history of savvy, ruthless<br/><span class=\"tmk\">20</span>Europeans conniving, tricking, enslaving, and bludgeoning innocent and guileless<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>natives out of their land and their lives. It's a neatly packed symbol of the entire<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>conquest of the continent that was to come.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Beyond that, the purchase snippet is notable because it is virtually the only thing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>about Manhattan colony that has become part of history. For this reason, too, it<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>deserves exploring.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>So, who were the Indians who agreed to this transaction, and what did they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>think it meant? The ancestors of the people whom European settlers took to calling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Indians (after Columbus, who at first thought he had arrived at the outer reaches of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>India) traveled the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska that existed during the last ice<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>age, more than twelve thousand years ago, then spread slowly through the Americas.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>They came from Asia; their genetic makeup is a close match with Siberians and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Mongolians.<span class=\"sup\">3</span> They spread out thinly across the incomprehensible vastness of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>American continents to create a linguistic richness unparalleled in human history: it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>has been estimated that at the moment Columbus arrived in the New World twentyfive<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>percent of all human languages were North American Indian.<span class=\"sup\">4</span><br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There are two rival, hardened stereotypes that get in the way of understanding<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>these people: the one that arose from the long cultural dismissing of American Indians<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as \"primitive,\" and the modern dogma that sees them as Noble and Defenseless.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Both are cartoon images. Recent work in genetics, archaeology, anthropology,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>and linguistics makes plain what should be obvious: that the Mohican, Mohawk,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Lenape, Montauk, Housatonic, and other peoples occupying the lands that for a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>time were called New Netherland, as well as the Massachusett, Wampanoag, Sokoki,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Pennacook, Abenaki, Oneida, Onondaga, Susquehannock, Nanticoke, and others<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>who inhabited other parts of what became the states of New York, Massachusetts,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Delaware, Maryland,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and New Jersey, were biologically, genetically, intellectually, all but identical to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Dutch, English, French, Swedish, and others who came in contact with them in the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>beginning of the seventeenth century. The Indians were as skilled, as duplicitous, as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>capable of theological rumination and technological cunning, as smart and as pigheaded,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>and as curious and cruel as the Europeans who met them. The members of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the Manhattan-based colony who knew them-who spent time among them in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>villages, hunted and traded with them, learned their languages-knew this perfectly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>well. It was later, after the two had separated into rival camps, that the stereotypes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>set. The early seventeenth century was a much more interesting time than the Wild<br/><span class=\"tmk\">55</span>West era, a time when Indians and Europeans were something like equal participants,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>dealing with one another as allies, competitors, partners.<p><sup>1</sup> The order of events is far from clear, and historians debate whether Verhulst or Minuit was the one who purchased Manhattan Island. My account is based on my own reading of all relevant primary source material, as well as arguments made by various historians. I side against those who in recent decades removed Minuit from his legendary position as purchaser of the island, and with those who reassign him to that position . . . .</p><p><sup>2</sup> Dave Barry, \"A Certified Wacko Rewrites History's Greatest Hits,\" Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, 26 December 1999.</p><p><sup>3</sup> Brian Sykes, The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry,</p><p>279\u2013280.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The main rhetorical function of the last sentence of the passage (lines 54\u201356) is to</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"325\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. offer a specific answer to the question that begins paragraph 4 (lines 26\u201327).</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"325\" type=\"radio\" value=\"B\"/>B. put to rest a misconception that is discussed in the last paragraph of the passage.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"325\" type=\"radio\" value=\"C\"/>C. summarize the main idea of the passage.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"325\" type=\"radio\" value=\"D\"/>D. provide a series of generalizations that are drawn from evidence in the passage.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"325\" type=\"radio\" value=\"E\"/>E. introduce a new twist on the subject that readers would do well to think about.</label></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"show-answer\" type=\"submit\">Show Answer</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"result\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">B</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"bold\">(B)</span> The speaker uses the last sentence to clear up various stereotyped impressions of American Indians.

Never before or afterwards in his life did he close<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a period so long as four years without some sensation of loss-some sentiment of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>habit-but school was what in after life he commonly heard his friends denounce as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an intolerable bore. He was born too old for it. The same thing could be said of most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>New England boys. Mentally they were never boys. Their education as men should<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have begun at ten years old. They were fully five years more mature than the English<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or European boy for whom schools were made. For the purposes of future advancement,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>as afterwards appeared, these first six years of a possible education were<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wasted in doing imperfectly what might have been done perfectly in one, and in any<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>case would have had small value. The next regular step was Harvard College. He was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>more than glad to go. For generation after generation, Adamses and Brookses and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Boylstons and Gorhams had gone to Harvard College, and although none of them,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>as far as known, had ever done any good there, or thought himself the better for it,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>custom, social ties, convenience, and above all, economy, kept each generation in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the track. Any other education would have required a serious effort, but no one took<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Harvard College seriously. All went there because their friends went there, and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>College was their ideal of social self-respect.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>Harvard College, as far as it educated at all, was a mild and liberal school, which<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sent young men into the world with all they needed to make respectable citizens,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and something of what they wanted to make useful ones. Leaders of men it never<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tried to make. Its ideas were altogether different.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Unitarian clergy had given to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>the College a character of moderation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>balance, judgment, restraint, what the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>called mesure; excellent traits, which the College attained with singular success, so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that its graduates could commonly be recognized by the stamp, but such a type of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character rarely lent itself to autobiography. In effect, the school created a type but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>not a will. Four years of Harvard College, if successful, resulted in an autobiographical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>blank, a mind on which only a water-mark had been stamped.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The stamp, as such things went, was a good one. The chief wonder of education is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it does not ruin everybody concerned with it, teachers and taught. Sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in after life, Adams debated whether in fact it had not ruined him and most of his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>companions, but, disappointment apart, Harvard College was probably less hurtful<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than any other University then in existence. It taught little, and that little ill, but it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>left the mind open, free from bias, ignorant of facts, but docile. The graduate had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few strong prejudices. He knew little, but his mind remained supple, ready to receive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>What caused the boy most disappointment was the little he got from his mates.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Speaking exactly, he got less than nothing, a result common enough in education.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Yet the College Catalogue for the years 1854\u00c2\u00a8C1861 shows a list of names rather distinguished<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in their time. Alexander Agassiz and Phillips Brooks led it. H. H. Richardson<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and O. W. Holmes helped to close it. As a rule the most promising of all die early, and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>never get their names into a Dictionary of Contemporaries which seems to be the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>only popular standard of success. Many died in the war. Adams knew them all, more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or less; he felt as much regard, and quite as much respect for them then, as he did<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>after they won great names and were objects of a vastly wider respect; but, as help<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>toward education, he got nothing whatever from them or they from him until long<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>after they had left College. Possibly the fault was his, but one would like to know how<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>many others shared it. Accident counts for as much in companionship as in marriage.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Life offers perhaps only a score of possible companions, and it is mere chance<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whether they meet as early as school or college, but it is more than a chance that boys<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>brought up together under like conditions have nothing to give

class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>The passage below is an excerpt from the autobiography of a 19th-century American literary figure</p><p><span class=\"tm2\"></span>One day in June, 1854, young Adams walked for the last time down the steps of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Mr. Dixwell's school in Boylston Place, and felt no sensation but one of unqualified<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>joy that this experience was ended. Never before or afterwards in his life did he close<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a period so long as four years without some sensation of loss-some sentiment of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>habit-but school was what in after life he commonly heard his friends denounce as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an intolerable bore. He was born too old for it. The same thing could be said of most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>New England boys. Mentally they were never boys. Their education as men should<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have begun at ten years old. They were fully five years more mature than the English<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or European boy for whom schools were made. For the purposes of future advancement,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>as afterwards appeared, these first six years of a possible education were<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wasted in doing imperfectly what might have been done perfectly in one, and in any<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>case would have had small value. The next regular step was Harvard College. He was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>more than glad to go. For generation after generation, Adamses and Brookses and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Boylstons and Gorhams had gone to Harvard College, and although none of them,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>as far as known, had ever done any good there, or thought himself the better for it,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>custom, social ties, convenience, and above all, economy, kept each generation in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the track. Any other education would have required a serious effort, but no one took<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Harvard College seriously. All went there because their friends went there, and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>College was their ideal of social self-respect.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>Harvard College, as far as it educated at all, was a mild and liberal school, which<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sent young men into the world with all they needed to make respectable citizens,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and something of what they wanted to make useful ones. Leaders of men it never<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tried to make. Its ideas were altogether different.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Unitarian clergy had given to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>the College a character of moderation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>balance, judgment, restraint, what the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>called mesure; excellent traits, which the College attained with singular success, so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that its graduates could commonly be recognized by the stamp, but such a type of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character rarely lent itself to autobiography. In effect, the school created a type but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>not a will. Four years of Harvard College, if successful, resulted in an autobiographical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>blank, a mind on which only a water-mark had been stamped.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The stamp, as such things went, was a good one. The chief wonder of education is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it does not ruin everybody concerned with it, teachers and taught. Sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in after life, Adams debated whether in fact it had not ruined him and most of his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>companions, but, disappointment apart, Harvard College was probably less hurtful<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than any other University then in existence. It taught little, and that little ill, but it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>left the mind open, free from bias, ignorant of facts, but docile. The graduate had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few strong prejudices. He knew little, but his mind remained supple, ready to receive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>What caused the boy most disappointment was the little he got from his mates.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Speaking exactly, he got less than nothing, a result common enough in education.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Yet the College Catalogue for the years 1854\u00c2\u00a8C1861 shows a list of names rather distinguished<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in their time. Alexander Agassiz and Phillips Brooks led it. H. H. Richardson<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and O. W. Holmes helped to close it. As a rule the most promising of all die early, and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>never get their names into a Dictionary of Contemporaries which seems to be the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>only popular standard of success. Many died in the war. Adams knew them all, more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or less; he felt as much regard, and quite as much respect for them then, as he did<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>after they won great names and were objects of a vastly wider respect; but, as help<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>toward education, he got nothing whatever from them or they from him until long<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>after they had left College. Possibly the fault was his, but one would like to know how<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>many others shared it. Accident counts for as much in companionship as in marriage.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Life offers perhaps only a score of possible companions, and it is mere chance<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whether they meet as early as school or college, but it is more than a chance that boys<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>brought up together under like conditions have nothing to give each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In line 3, the phrase \"this experience\" refers to Adams'</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"327\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. lack of sensation.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"327\" type=\"radio\" value=\"B\"/>B. attendance at Mr. Dixwell's school.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"327\" type=\"radio\" value=\"C\"/>C. walk down the steps.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"327\" type=\"radio\" value=\"D\"/>D. graduation after four years.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"327\" type=\"radio\" value=\"E\"/>E. boredom.</label></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"show-answer\" type=\"submit\">Show Answer</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"result\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">B</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"bold\">(B)</span> The experience is young Adams' career at Mr. Dixwell's school.

Adams knew them all, more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or less; he felt as much regard, and quite as much respect for them then, as he did<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>after they won great names and were objects of a vastly wider respect; but, as help<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>toward education, he got nothing whatever from them or they from him until long<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>after they had left College.

For the purposes of future advancement,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>as afterwards appeared, these first six years of a possible education were<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wasted in doing imperfectly what might have been done perfectly in one, and in any<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>case would have had small value. The next regular step was Harvard College. He was<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>more than glad to go. For generation after generation, Adamses and Brookses and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Boylstons and Gorhams had gone to Harvard College, and although none of them,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>as far as known, had ever done any good there, or thought himself the better for it,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>custom, social ties, convenience, and above all, economy, kept each generation in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the track. Any other education would have required a serious effort, but no one took<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Harvard College seriously. All went there because their friends went there, and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>College was their ideal of social self-respect.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>Harvard College, as far as it educated at all, was a mild and liberal school, which<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sent young men into the world with all they needed to make respectable citizens,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and something of what they wanted to make useful ones. Leaders of men it never<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tried to make. Its ideas were altogether different.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Unitarian clergy had given to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>the College a character of moderation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>balance, judgment, restraint, what the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>called mesure; excellent traits, which the College attained with singular success, so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that its graduates could commonly be recognized by the stamp, but such a type of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character rarely lent itself to autobiography. In effect, the school created a type but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>not a will. Four years of Harvard College, if successful, resulted in an autobiographical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>blank, a mind on which only a water-mark had been stamped.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The stamp, as such things went, was a good one. The chief wonder of education is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it does not ruin everybody concerned with it, teachers and taught. Sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in after life, Adams debated whether in fact it had not ruined him and most of his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>companions, but, disappointment apart, Harvard College was probably less hurtful<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than any other University then in existence. It taught little, and that little ill, but it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>left the mind open, free from bias, ignorant of facts, but docile. The graduate had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few strong prejudices. He knew little, but his mind remained supple, ready to receive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>What caused the boy most disappointment was the little he got from his mates.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Speaking exactly, he got less than nothing, a result common enough in education.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Yet the College Catalogue for the years 1854\u00a8C1861 shows a list of names rather distinguished<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in their time.

Any other education would have required a serious effort, but no one took<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Harvard College seriously. All went there because their friends went there, and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>College was their ideal of social self-respect.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>Harvard College, as far as it educated at all, was a mild and liberal school, which<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sent young men into the world with all they needed to make respectable citizens,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and something of what they wanted to make useful ones. Leaders of men it never<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tried to make. Its ideas were altogether different.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Unitarian clergy had given to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>the College a character of moderation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>balance, judgment, restraint, what the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>called mesure; excellent traits, which the College attained with singular success, so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that its graduates could commonly be recognized by the stamp, but such a type of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character rarely lent itself to autobiography. In effect, the school created a type but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>not a will. Four years of Harvard College, if successful, resulted in an autobiographical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>blank, a mind on which only a water-mark had been stamped.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The stamp, as such things went, was a good one. The chief wonder of education is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it does not ruin everybody concerned with it, teachers and taught. Sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in after life, Adams debated whether in fact it had not ruined him and most of his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>companions, but, disappointment apart, Harvard College was probably less hurtful<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than any other University then in existence. It taught little, and that little ill, but it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>left the mind open, free from bias, ignorant of facts, but docile. The graduate had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few strong prejudices. He knew little, but his mind remained supple, ready to receive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>What caused the boy most disappointment was the little he got from his mates.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Speaking exactly, he got less than nothing, a result common enough in education.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Yet the College Catalogue for the years 1854\u00a8C1861 shows a list of names rather distinguished<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in their time. Alexander Agassiz and Phillips Brooks led it. H. H. Richardson<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and O. W. Holmes helped to close it. As a rule the most promising of all die early, and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>never get their names into a Dictionary of Contemporaries which seems to be the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>only popular standard of success.

Adams knew them all, more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or less; he felt as much regard, and quite as much respect for them then, as he did<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>after they won great names and were objects of a vastly wider respect; but, as help<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>toward education, he got nothing whatever from them or they from him until long<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>after they had left College. Possibly the fault was his, but one would like to know how<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>many others shared it. Accident counts for as much in companionship as in marriage.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Life offers perhaps only a score of possible companions, and it is mere chance<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whether they meet as early as school or college, but it is more than a chance that boys<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>brought up together under like conditions have nothing to give each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The effects of a Harvard education discussed in lines 20\u201322 are referred to elsewhere as which of the following?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"332\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. above all, economy (line 16)</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"332\" type=\"radio\" value=\"B\"/>B. serious effort (line 17)</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"332\" type=\"radio\" value=\"C\"/>C. less hurtful (line 33)</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"332\" type=\"radio\" value=\"D\"/>D. ready to receive knowledge (lines 36\u201337)</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"332\" type=\"radio\" value=\"E\"/>E. less than nothing (line 39)</label></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"show-answer\" type=\"submit\">Show Answer</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"result\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">D</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"bold\">(D)</span> The phrase \"something of what they wanted to make useful ones\" (line 22) suggests that a Harvard degree was not the end of a young man's education.

Never before or afterwards in his life did he close<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a period so long as four years without some sensation of loss-some sentiment of<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>habit-but school was what in after life he commonly heard his friends denounce as<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an intolerable bore. He was born too old for it. The same thing could be said of most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>New England boys. Mentally they were never boys. Their education as men should<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have begun at ten years old. They were fully five years more mature than the English<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or European boy for whom schools were made. For the purposes of future advancement,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>as afterwards appeared, these first six years of a possible education were<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>wasted in doing imperfectly what might have been done perfectly in one, and in any<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>case would have had small value.

All went there because their friends went there, and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>College was their ideal of social self-respect.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>Harvard College, as far as it educated at all, was a mild and liberal school, which<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sent young men into the world with all they needed to make respectable citizens,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and something of what they wanted to make useful ones. Leaders of men it never<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tried to make. Its ideas were altogether different.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Unitarian clergy had given to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>the College a character of moderation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>balance, judgment, restraint, what the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>called mesure; excellent traits, which the College attained with singular success, so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that its graduates could commonly be recognized by the stamp, but such a type of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character rarely lent itself to autobiography. In effect, the school created a type but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>not a will. Four years of Harvard College, if successful, resulted in an autobiographical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>blank, a mind on which only a water-mark had been stamped.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The stamp, as such things went, was a good one. The chief wonder of education is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it does not ruin everybody concerned with it, teachers and taught. Sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in after life, Adams debated whether in fact it had not ruined him and most of his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>companions, but, disappointment apart, Harvard College was probably less hurtful<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than any other University then in existence. It taught little, and that little ill, but it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>left the mind open, free from bias, ignorant of facts, but docile. The graduate had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few strong prejudices. He knew little, but his mind remained supple, ready to receive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>What caused the boy most disappointment was the little he got from his mates.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Speaking exactly, he got less than nothing, a result common enough in education.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Yet the College Catalogue for the years 1854\u00a8C1861 shows a list of names rather distinguished<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in their time. Alexander Agassiz and Phillips Brooks led it. H. H. Richardson<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and O. W. Holmes helped to close it.

Its ideas were altogether different.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>The Unitarian clergy had given to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>the College a character of moderation,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>balance, judgment, restraint, what the French<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>called mesure; excellent traits, which the College attained with singular success, so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that its graduates could commonly be recognized by the stamp, but such a type of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>character rarely lent itself to autobiography. In effect, the school created a type but<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>not a will. Four years of Harvard College, if successful, resulted in an autobiographical<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>blank, a mind on which only a water-mark had been stamped.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The stamp, as such things went, was a good one. The chief wonder of education is<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>that it does not ruin everybody concerned with it, teachers and taught. Sometimes<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in after life, Adams debated whether in fact it had not ruined him and most of his<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>companions, but, disappointment apart, Harvard College was probably less hurtful<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>than any other University then in existence. It taught little, and that little ill, but it<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>left the mind open, free from bias, ignorant of facts, but docile. The graduate had<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>few strong prejudices. He knew little, but his mind remained supple, ready to receive<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>knowledge.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">40</span>What caused the boy most disappointment was the little he got from his mates.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Speaking exactly, he got less than nothing, a result common enough in education.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Yet the College Catalogue for the years 1854\u00c2\u00a8C1861 shows a list of names rather distinguished<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>in their time. Alexander Agassiz and Phillips Brooks led it. H. H. Richardson<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and O. W. Holmes helped to close it. As a rule the most promising of all die early, and<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>never get their names into a Dictionary of Contemporaries which seems to be the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>only popular standard of success. Many died in the war. Adams knew them all, more<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>or less; he felt as much regard, and quite as much respect for them then, as he did<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>after they won great names and were objects of a vastly wider respect; but, as help<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>toward education, he got nothing whatever from them or they from him until long<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>after they had left College. Possibly the fault was his, but one would like to know how<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>many others shared it. Accident counts for as much in companionship as in marriage.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Life offers perhaps only a score of possible companions, and it is mere chance<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>whether they meet as early as school or college, but it is more than a chance that boys<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>brought up together under like conditions have nothing to give each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The speaker in the passage can best be described as a person inclined to believe all of the following EXCEPT that</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"339\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. a Harvard education in the mid-19th century left much to be desired.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"339\" type=\"radio\" value=\"B\"/>B. the maturity of boys from abroad tended to lag behind the maturity of boys from New England.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"339\" type=\"radio\" value=\"C\"/>C. to be a Harvard student was socially desirable and advantageous.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"339\" type=\"radio\" value=\"D\"/>D.

There is a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>tide in the affairs of children. Civilization is cruel in sending them to bed at the most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>stimulating time of dusk. Summer dusk, especially, is the frolic moment for children,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>baffle them how you may. They may have been in a pottering mood all day, intent<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>upon all kinds of close industries, breathing hard over choppings and poundings.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>But when late twilight comes, there comes also the punctual wildness. The children<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>will run and pursue, and laugh for the mere movement-it does so jolt their spirits.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>What remembrances does this imply of the hunt, what of the predatory dark? The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>kitten grows alert at the same hour, and hunts for moths and crickets in the grass. It<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>comes like an imp, leaping on all fours. The children lie in ambush and fall upon one<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>another in the mimicry of hunting. The sudden outbreak of action is complained of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>as a defiance and a rebellion. Their entertainers are tired, and the children are to go<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>home. But, with more or less of life and fire, the children strike some blow for liberty.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>It may be the impotent revolt of the ineffectual child, or the stroke of the conqueror;<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>but something, something is done for freedom under the early stars.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>This is not the only time when the energy of children is in conflict with the weariness<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of men. But it is less tolerable that the energy of men should be at odds with<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>the weariness of children, which happens at some time of their jaunts together,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>especially, alas! in the jaunts of the poor.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>Of games for the summer dusk when it rains, cards are most beloved by children.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Three tiny girls were to be taught \"Old Maid\" to beguile the time. One of them, a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>nut-brown child of five, was persuading another to play. \"Oh, come,\" she said, \"and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>play with me at 'New Maid.'\"<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>The time of falling asleep is a child's immemorial and incalculable hour. It is full<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>of traditions, and beset by antique habits. The habit of prehistoric races has been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>cited as the only explanation of the fixity of some customs in mankind. But if the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>inquirers who appeal to that beginning remembered better their own infancy, they<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>would seek no further. See the habits in falling to sleep which have children in their<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>thralldom. Try to overcome them in any child, and his own conviction of their high<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>antiquity weakens your hand.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Childhood is antiquity, and with the sense of time and the sense of mystery is connected<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for ever to the hearing of a lullaby. The French sleep-song is the most romantic.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There is in it such a sound of history as must inspire any imaginative child, falling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to sleep, with a sense of the incalculable; and the songs themselves are old. \"Le Bon<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>Roi Dagobert\" has been sung over French cradles since the legend was fresh. The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>nurse knows nothing more sleepy than the tune and the verse that she herself slept<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to when a child. The gaiety of the thirteenth century, in \"Le Pont d'Avignon,\" is put<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mysteriously to sleep, away in the t\u00a8?te \u00a8\u00a4 t\u00a8?te of child and nurse, in a thousand little<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sequestered rooms at night. \"Malbrook\" would be comparatively modern, were not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>all things that are sung to a drowsing child as distant as the day of Abraham.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>If English children are not rocked to many such aged lullabies, some of them are<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>put to sleep to strange cradle-songs. The affectionate races that are brought into<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>subjection sing the primitive lullaby to the white child. Asiatic voices and African<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>persuade him to sleep in the tropical night. His closing eyes are filled with alien<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>images.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The sentence \"There is a tide in the affairs of children\" (lines 1\u20132) functions chiefly

Try to overcome them in any child, and his own conviction of their high<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>antiquity weakens your hand.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>Childhood is antiquity, and with the sense of time and the sense of mystery is connected<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for ever to the hearing of a lullaby. The French sleep-song is the most romantic.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>There is in it such a sound of history as must inspire any imaginative child, falling<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to sleep, with a sense of the incalculable; and the songs themselves are old. \"Le Bon<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>Roi Dagobert\" has been sung over French cradles since the legend was fresh. The<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>nurse knows nothing more sleepy than the tune and the verse that she herself slept<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to when a child. The gaiety of the thirteenth century, in \"Le Pont d'Avignon,\" is put<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>mysteriously to sleep, away in the t\u00a8?te \u00a8\u00a4 t\u00a8?te of child and nurse, in a thousand little<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sequestered rooms at night. \"Malbrook\" would be comparatively modern, were not<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>all things that are sung to a drowsing child as distant as the day of Abraham.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>If English children are not rocked to many such aged lullabies, some of them are<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>put to sleep to strange cradle-songs. The affectionate races that are brought into<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>subjection sing the primitive lullaby to the white child. Asiatic voices and African<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>persuade him to sleep in the tropical night. His closing eyes are filled with alien<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>images.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The author's tone in the passage as a whole is best described as</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"350\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. contemplative and tender.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"350\" type=\"radio\" value=\"B\"/>B. casual and meandering.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"350\" type=\"radio\" value=\"C\"/>C. strict and dogmatic.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"350\" type=\"radio\" value=\"D\"/>D. scientific and aggressive.</label></div><div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"350\" type=\"radio\" value=\"E\"/>E. enthusiastic and extravagant.</label></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button class=\"btn btn-primary\" id=\"show-answer\" type=\"submit\">Show Answer</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"result\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">A</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><span class=\"bold\">(A)</span> The speaker observes children affectionately, almost sentimentally.

The sense of approach was already<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>almost intolerably strong at Liverpool, where, I remember, the perception of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>English character of everything was as acute as a surprise, though it could only be a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>surprise without a shock. It was expectation exquisitely gratified, superabundantly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>confirmed. There was a kind of wonder indeed that England should be as English as,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for my entertainment, she took the trouble to be; but the wonder would have been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>greater, and all the pleasure absent, if the sensation had not been violent. It seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to sit there again like a visiting presence, as it sat opposite me at breakfast at a small<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>table in a window of the old coffee-room of the Adelphi Hotel-the unextended<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(as it then was), the unimproved, the unblushingly local Adelphi. Liverpool is not a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>romantic city, but that smoky Saturday returns to me as a supreme success, measured<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by its association with the kind of emotion in the hope of which, for the most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>part, we betake ourselves to far countries.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>It assumed this character at an early hour-or rather indeed twenty-four hours<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>before-with the sight, as one looked across the wintry ocean, of the strange, dark,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lonely freshness of the coast of Ireland. Better still, before we could come up to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>city, were the black steamers knocking about in the yellow Mersey, under a sky so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>low that they seemed to touch it with their funnels, and in the thickest, windiest<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>light. Spring was already in the air, in the town; there was no rain, but there was still<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>less sun-one wondered what had become, on this side of the world, of the big white<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>splotch in the heavens; and the gray mildness, shading away into black at every pretext,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>appeared in itself a promise. This was how it hung about me, between the window<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and the fire, in the coffee-room of the hotel-late in the morning for breakfast,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>as we had been long in disembarking. The other passengers had dispersed, knowingly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>catching trains for London (we had only been a handful); I had the place to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>myself, and I felt as if I had an exclusive property in the impression. I prolonged it, I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sacrificed to it, and it is perfectly recoverable now, with the very taste of the national<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>muffin, the creak of the waiter's shoes as he came and went (could anything be so<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>English as his intensely professional back? it revealed a country of tradition), and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>rustle of the newspaper I was too excited to read.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>I continued to sacrifice for the rest of the day; it didn't seem to me a sentient1<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>thing, as yet, to inquire into the means of getting away. My curiosity must indeed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have languished, for I found myself on the morrow in the slowest of Sunday trains,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>pottering up to London with an interruptedness which might have been tedious<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>without the conversation of an old gentleman who shared the carriage with me and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to whom my alien as well as comparatively youthful character had betrayed itself.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>He instructed me as to the sights of London, and impressed upon me that nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was more worthy of my attention than the great cathedral of St. Paul. \"Have you<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>seen St. Peter's in Rome? St. Peter's is more highly embellished, you know; but you<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>may depend upon it that St. Paul's is the better building of the two.\" The impression<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I began with speaking of was, strictly, that of the drive from Euston, after dark, to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Morely's Hotel in Trafalgar Square. It was not lovely-it was in fact rather horrible;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>but as I move again through dusky tortuous miles, in the greasy four-wheeler to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>which my luggage had compelled me to commit myself, I recognize the first step in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an initiation of which the subsequent stages were to abound in pleasant

that I count as virtually a first impression- the end of<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>a wet, black Sunday, twenty years ago, about the first of March. There had been an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>earlier vision, but it had turned gray, like faded ink, and the occasion I speak of was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a fresh beginning. No doubt I had a mystic prescience of how fond of the murky<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>Babylon I was one day to become; certain it is that as I look back I find every small<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>circumstance of those hours of approach and arrival still as vivid as if the solemnity<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of an opening era had breathed upon it. The sense of approach was already<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>almost intolerably strong at Liverpool, where, I remember, the perception of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>English character of everything was as acute as a surprise, though it could only be a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>surprise without a shock. It was expectation exquisitely gratified, superabundantly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>confirmed. There was a kind of wonder indeed that England should be as English as,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for my entertainment, she took the trouble to be; but the wonder would have been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>greater, and all the pleasure absent, if the sensation had not been violent. It seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to sit there again like a visiting presence, as it sat opposite me at breakfast at a small<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>table in a window of the old coffee-room of the Adelphi Hotel-the unextended<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(as it then was), the unimproved, the unblushingly local Adelphi. Liverpool is not a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>romantic city, but that smoky Saturday returns to me as a supreme success, measured<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by its association with the kind of emotion in the hope of which, for the most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>part, we betake ourselves to far countries.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>It assumed this character at an early hour-or rather indeed twenty-four hours<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>before-with the sight, as one looked across the wintry ocean, of the strange, dark,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lonely freshness of the coast of Ireland. Better still, before we could come up to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>city, were the black steamers knocking about in the yellow Mersey, under a sky so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>low that they seemed to touch it with their funnels, and in the thickest, windiest<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>light. Spring was already in the air, in the town; there was no rain, but there was still<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>less sun-one wondered what had become, on this side of the world, of the big white<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>splotch in the heavens; and the gray mildness, shading away into black at every pretext,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>appeared in itself a promise. This was how it hung about me, between the window<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and the fire, in the coffee-room of the hotel-late in the morning for breakfast,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>as we had been long in disembarking. The other passengers had dispersed, knowingly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>catching trains for London (we had only been a handful); I had the place to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>myself, and I felt as if I had an exclusive property in the impression. I prolonged it, I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sacrificed to it, and it is perfectly recoverable now, with the very taste of the national<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>muffin, the creak of the waiter's shoes as he came and went (could anything be so<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>English as his intensely professional back? it revealed a country of tradition), and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>rustle of the newspaper I was too excited to read.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>I continued to sacrifice for the rest of the day; it didn't seem to me a sentient1<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>thing, as yet, to inquire into the means of getting away.

This was how it hung about me, between the window<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and the fire, in the coffee-room of the hotel-late in the morning for breakfast,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>as we had been long in disembarking. The other passengers had dispersed, knowingly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>catching trains for London (we had only been a handful); I had the place to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>myself, and I felt as if I had an exclusive property in the impression. I prolonged it, I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sacrificed to it, and it is perfectly recoverable now, with the very taste of the national<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>muffin, the creak of the waiter's shoes as he came and went (could anything be so<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>English as his intensely professional back? it revealed a country of tradition), and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>rustle of the newspaper I was too excited to read.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>I continued to sacrifice for the rest of the day; it didn't seem to me a sentient1<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>thing, as yet, to inquire into the means of getting away. My curiosity must indeed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have languished, for I found myself on the morrow in the slowest of Sunday trains,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>pottering up to London with an interruptedness which might have been tedious<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>without the conversation of an old gentleman who shared the carriage with me and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to whom my alien as well as comparatively youthful character had betrayed itself.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>He instructed me as to the sights of London, and impressed upon me that nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was more worthy of my attention than the great cathedral of St. Paul. \"Have you<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>seen St. Peter's in Rome?

There had been an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>earlier vision, but it had turned gray, like faded ink, and the occasion I speak of was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a fresh beginning. No doubt I had a mystic prescience of how fond of the murky<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>Babylon I was one day to become; certain it is that as I look back I find every small<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>circumstance of those hours of approach and arrival still as vivid as if the solemnity<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of an opening era had breathed upon it. The sense of approach was already<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>almost intolerably strong at Liverpool, where, I remember, the perception of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>English character of everything was as acute as a surprise, though it could only be a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>surprise without a shock. It was expectation exquisitely gratified, superabundantly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>confirmed. There was a kind of wonder indeed that England should be as English as,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for my entertainment, she took the trouble to be; but the wonder would have been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>greater, and all the pleasure absent, if the sensation had not been violent. It seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to sit there again like a visiting presence, as it sat opposite me at breakfast at a small<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>table in a window of the old coffee-room of the Adelphi Hotel-the unextended<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(as it then was), the unimproved, the unblushingly local Adelphi. Liverpool is not a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>romantic city, but that smoky Saturday returns to me as a supreme success, measured<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by its association with the kind of emotion in the hope of which, for the most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>part, we betake ourselves to far countries.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>It assumed this character at an early hour-or rather indeed twenty-four hours<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>before-with the sight, as one looked across the wintry ocean, of the strange, dark,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lonely freshness of the coast of Ireland. Better still, before we could come up to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>city, were the black steamers knocking about in the yellow Mersey, under a sky so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>low that they seemed to touch it with their funnels, and in the thickest, windiest<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>light. Spring was already in the air, in the town; there was no rain, but there was still<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>less sun-one wondered what had become, on this side of the world, of the big white<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>splotch in the heavens; and the gray mildness, shading away into black at every pretext,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>appeared in itself a promise.

There had been an<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>earlier vision, but it had turned gray, like faded ink, and the occasion I speak of was<br/><span class=\"tmk\">Line</span></p><td>a fresh beginning. No doubt I had a mystic prescience of how fond of the murky<br/><span class=\"tmk\">5</span>Babylon I was one day to become; certain it is that as I look back I find every small<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>circumstance of those hours of approach and arrival still as vivid as if the solemnity<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>of an opening era had breathed upon it. The sense of approach was already<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>almost intolerably strong at Liverpool, where, I remember, the perception of the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>English character of everything was as acute as a surprise, though it could only be a<br/><span class=\"tmk\">10</span>surprise without a shock. It was expectation exquisitely gratified, superabundantly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>confirmed. There was a kind of wonder indeed that England should be as English as,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>for my entertainment, she took the trouble to be; but the wonder would have been<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>greater, and all the pleasure absent, if the sensation had not been violent. It seems<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to sit there again like a visiting presence, as it sat opposite me at breakfast at a small<br/><span class=\"tmk\">15</span>table in a window of the old coffee-room of the Adelphi Hotel-the unextended<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>(as it then was), the unimproved, the unblushingly local Adelphi. Liverpool is not a<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>romantic city, but that smoky Saturday returns to me as a supreme success, measured<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>by its association with the kind of emotion in the hope of which, for the most<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>part, we betake ourselves to far countries.<br/><span class=\"tmk2\">20</span>It assumed this character at an early hour-or rather indeed twenty-four hours<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>before-with the sight, as one looked across the wintry ocean, of the strange, dark,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>lonely freshness of the coast of Ireland. Better still, before we could come up to the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>city, were the black steamers knocking about in the yellow Mersey, under a sky so<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>low that they seemed to touch it with their funnels, and in the thickest, windiest<br/><span class=\"tmk\">25</span>light. Spring was already in the air, in the town; there was no rain, but there was still<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>less sun-one wondered what had become, on this side of the world, of the big white<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>splotch in the heavens; and the gray mildness, shading away into black at every pretext,<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>appeared in itself a promise. This was how it hung about me, between the window<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>and the fire, in the coffee-room of the hotel-late in the morning for breakfast,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">30</span>as we had been long in disembarking. The other passengers had dispersed, knowingly<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>catching trains for London (we had only been a handful); I had the place to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>myself, and I felt as if I had an exclusive property in the impression. I prolonged it, I<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>sacrificed to it, and it is perfectly recoverable now, with the very taste of the national<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>muffin, the creak of the waiter's shoes as he came and went (could anything be so<br/><span class=\"tmk\">35</span>English as his intensely professional back? it revealed a country of tradition), and the<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>rustle of the newspaper I was too excited to read.<br/><span class=\"tm2\"></span>I continued to sacrifice for the rest of the day; it didn't seem to me a sentient1<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>thing, as yet, to inquire into the means of getting away. My curiosity must indeed<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>have languished, for I found myself on the morrow in the slowest of Sunday trains,<br/><span class=\"tmk\">40</span>pottering up to London with an interruptedness which might have been tedious<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>without the conversation of an old gentleman who shared the carriage with me and<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>to whom my alien as well as comparatively youthful character had betrayed itself.<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>He instructed me as to the sights of London, and impressed upon me that nothing<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>was more worthy of my attention than the great cathedral of St. Paul. \"Have you<br/><span class=\"tmk\">45</span>seen St. Peter's in Rome? St. Peter's is more highly embellished, you know; but you<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>may depend upon it that St. Paul's is the better building of the two.\" The impression<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>I began with speaking of was, strictly, that of the drive from Euston, after dark, to<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>Morely's Hotel in Trafalgar Square. It was not lovely-it was in fact rather horrible;<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>but as I move again through dusky tortuous miles, in the greasy four-wheeler to<br/><span class=\"tmk\">50</span>which my luggage had compelled me to commit myself, I recognize the first step in<br/><span class=\"tm\"></span>an initiation of which the subsequent stages were to abound in pleasant things.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The speaker in the passage can best be described as a person who</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"radio\"><label><input name=\"363\" type=\"radio\" value=\"A\"/>A. habitually
