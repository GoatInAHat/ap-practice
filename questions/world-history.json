The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]\u2026.The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year\u2026.</p><p class=\"indent\">And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.</p><p class=\"indent\">And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines\u2026.And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]\u2026at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays.

Likewise, their exchanges with Chinese people were limited. Both the Portuguese and the British (as well as the Dutch) traded with China (B).

This created a huge demand for silver, driving mining efforts by the Spanish in the Americas. Because the Portuguese did not have the resources to maintain control of the Indian Ocean trade, their prestige and power declined (A).
