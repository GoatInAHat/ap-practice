He believed, for example, that the king of England had no power to give away land that clearly belonged to the Native Americans. He also felt that the state was an imperfect vehicle for the imposition of God's will on Earth, so he advocated religious tolerance and the separation of church and state. Such ideas were pure anathema to the Puritans, who had settled Massachusetts Bay to establish precisely the type of state that Williams preached against. Neither easygoing nor good sports, the Puritans eventually banished Williams. Williams moved to what is now Rhode Island, received a charter, and founded a new colony.

Its most prominent spokesmen were Congregationalist preacher Jonathan Edwards and Methodist preacher George Whitefield. From 1739 until his death in 1770, Whitefield toured the colonies preaching what has since come to be known as \"revivalism.\" The period was marked by the creation of a number of evangelical churches, emphasis on the emotional power of religion, and, briefly, a return of the persecution of witches. Whitefield was a native of England, where the Enlightenment was in full swing; its effects were also beginning to be felt in the colonies. The Enlightenment was a natural outgrowth of the Renaissance, during which Europe rediscovered the great works of the ancient world and began to assimilate some of its ideals. While European thinkers of the time did not turn their backs on religion, they also entertained ideas about the value of empirical thought and scientific inquiry that were not entirely consonant with contemporary religious beliefs. Further, they began to view humanity as a more important\u2014and God as a less important\u2014force in shaping human history. The First Great Awakening is usually characterized as a response to the threats posed by the intellectual trends of the Enlightenment.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p class=\"indent\">\"I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters.

Rather, it was governed as a republican Commonwealth, with its leader, Oliver Cromwell, named \"lord protector.\" The English Civil Wars, between 1642 and 1648, are often called the Puritan Revolution because they pitted the Puritans against the Crown. Royalists fought for the divine right of the king to rule and the maintenance of the Church of England (the Episcopal Church) as the official church of state. The Puritans fought for a republican Commonwealth and a greater level of state tolerance for freedom of religion. The Puritans won and, for a little over a decade, ruled England. The death of Cromwell (1658) robbed the Puritans of their best-known and most respected leader, and by 1660 the Stuarts were restored to the throne. During the Interregnum, Puritans had little motive to move to the New World. Everything they wanted\u2014freedom to practice their religion, representation in the government\u2014was available to them in England.

Scott declared himself a free man, and a series of court cases ruled variously for and against his claim. The case finally reached the Supreme Court in 1857. Taney's ruling was remarkable in that it far exceeded the scope of the case. Taney could simply have ruled on the merits of the case; instead, he decided to establish a wide-ranging precedent. Slaves, he said, were property, and as such could be transported anywhere. Because slaves were not citizens, Taney further reasoned, they could not sue in federal court (thereby eliminating the possibility of the court reviewing any such cases in the future). Taney topped off his decision by stating that Congress could neither prevent settlers from transporting their slaves to western territories nor could it legislate slavery in those areas, thus nullifying the Missouri Compromise and rendering the concept of popular sovereignty unconstitutional.

It was the great cause of the Populist party, which argued that the existing monetary practices favored the wealthy and elite, particularly in the Northeast. Free coinage of silver, the party argued, would cause inflation but would also put more money in circulation, making it easier for farmers to pay off their debts. Furthermore, Populists felt that a larger money supply was appropriate to the United States' tremendous growth rate at that time. The policy was naturally quite popular with farmers, but not with bankers, who would have had their loans repaid with devalued currency.

Federalists, on the other hand, opposed to the war because it disrupted trade and unaware that its end was coming, met in Hartford, Connecticut, to consider a massive overhaul of the Constitution or, failing that, secession.

His solution included the formation of a national bank, modeled on the Bank of England. Through the bank, Hamilton hoped to consolidate and manage the nation's debt and provide an agency through which a national currency could be circulated. He<a></a> also wished to broaden the powers of the federal government (Hamilton, a Federalist, favored a strong central government). Both houses of Congress approved Hamilton's plan, but Washington (then president) was reluctant to sign the bill because he was uncertain of its constitutionality. (Note: Washington performed very conservatively as president, aware that any action he took would set a precedent for his followers. Accordingly, he used his veto only when he was certain that a bill was unconstitutional.) The debate that followed defined the two main schools of thought on constitutional law. On one side were the strict constructionists, led by Jefferson and Madison. Both were wary of a strong central government and interpreted the Constitution accordingly. The strict constructionists argued that the Constitution allowed Congress only those powers specifically granted it or those \"necessary and proper\" to the execution of its enumerated powers. While a bank might be convenient and perhaps beneficial, they argued, it was not necessary, and thus its creation was beyond the powers of the national government. Hamilton, not surprisingly, disagreed. In his \"Defense of the Constitutionality of the Bank,\" he proposed what has come to be known as the broad-constructionist view. He argued that the creation of a bank was an implied power of the government, because it already had explicit power to coin money, borrow money, and collect taxes. Hamilton argued that the government could do anything in the execution of those enumerated powers\u2014including creating a bank\u2014that was not explicitly forbidden by the Constitution.

Many electors were chosen by state legislatures, which chose electors who agreed with the choices of the caucus (often they were the same men who had participated in the caucus). By 1824, however, a majority of states allowed voters to choose their presidential electors directly. When the Republican caucus chose William H.

Congress struck on the Dawes Severalty Act, which offered individual Native Americans 160-acre plots in return for leaving their reservations; through this program Congress hoped to hasten the assimilation of Native Americans, whose cultures most congressmen held in contempt.

Many argued that America should stick to the foreign policy suggested in both George Washington's farewell address and the Monroe Doctrine, and therefore (1) avoid political alliances with other countries and (2) remain neutral regarding European conflicts. Wilson negotiated the Treaty of Versailles (the peace treaty following World War I) for the United States. He was unable to get a treaty that reflected his conciliatory Fourteen Points, as the Allies demanded a treaty that punished Germany harshly.

After the American victory in the Revolution, there was a great deal of debate about the status of the area between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. Some states insisted that their western land claims from the colonial period should be honored, while other states had no claims on this land. Maryland, a state with no western land claims, insisted that it would not ratify the Articles until all states gave up their land claims and the western lands became part of a national domain. Congress persuaded the states with claims to do just that. The handling of western lands was considered one of the major successes of the Articles of Confederation government. The maps do not indicate any French land claims (B), nor do they refer to slavery (C).

The act encouraged fair treatment of native peoples, but it did not recognize their earlier claims to the land, setting the stage for a series of clashes between whites and American Indians during the 1780s and 1790s in the Ohio River Valley and Great Lakes region. In general, the Northwest Ordinance is considered an important piece of legislation from the \"critical period.\" It divided up the land and provided a plot in every town for public schools. The Northwest Ordinance spelled out the steps that these areas would have to go through in order to become states, on equal footing with the original 13 states (C).

The United States and Spain negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1898) following the war. In the treaty, Spain agreed to cede the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States; the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million for these possessions.

Faubus knew that alluding to the Reconstruction period would resonate among white southerners; bitterness over that period was still present in the collective memory of white southerners almost a hundred years later. The conflict began when local authorities had decided to allow nine African American students to enroll in Central High School at the beginning of the school year in 1957. Governor Orval Faubus refused to cooperate with the plan, leading to mob action and violence outside of the high school. The violence and the national news coverage of the flouting of federal authority convinced Eisenhower to send federal troops.

Settlement houses, such as Hull House, were established to aid immigrants, especially immigrant women. By 1911 more than 400 settlement houses existed in the United States, usually run by women.

The cartoon is an expression of isolationism, which became a common sentiment among many Americans between the two world wars. The cartoon is implying that war may be seductive, but it is also brutal and deadly. Many Americans had vivid memories of World War I, and many had lost friends and loved ones. Ultimately, many asked, was it worth it? In addition, the Senate's Nye committee (1934\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1937) uncovered evidence that certain American corporations greatly profited from World War I.

The movement to ban alcohol from American society was one of the largest movements in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

This decline in trade hit South Carolina's cotton plantations especially hard. By 1832, John C.

Under the theory of nullification, a state could declare an objectionable law null and void within that state.

He pushed for passage of the Force Bill, which authorized military force against South Carolina for committing treason.

The Hartford Convention (1814) raised the very real possibility that New England would secede from the United States in order to protect their economic and maritime trade interests. Although talk of nullification and secession is more associated with southern political leaders, these issues were also brought up in the intense debates about the War of 1812.

This debate first become part of the national agenda during the Progressive era of the early decades of the twentieth century, when reformers insisted that the federal government should play a greater role in regulating economic activity in the United States. The debate continued through the New Deal, the Great Society, and into the debates in recent decades about the federal government playing a role in reforming the health care system. Some conservatives accused the Supreme Court of legislating from the bench in the 1950s and 1960s, under Chief Justice Earl Warren (B).

Johnson's Great Society programs included Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program provides health care for every American once each reaches the age of 65. The main components of Johnson's Great Society were landmark civil rights acts as well as a comprehensive \"war on poverty.\" Many aspects of Johnson's Great Society were underfunded as the federal government spent more and more on the Vietnam War.

Social Darwinism was an attempt to apply Charles Darwin's ideas about the natural world to social relations. Sumner was attracted to Darwin's ideas about competition and Herbert Spencer's term, \"survival of the fittest.\" He argued against any attempt at government intervention into the economic and social spheres. Interference, he argued, would hinder the evolution of the human species. The inequalities of wealth that characterized the late 1800s were part of the process of \"survival of the fittest.\" Social Darwinism appealed to owners of large corporations, because it both justified their wealth and power and warned against any type of regulation or reform.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p class=\"indent\">\"A drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be. . . .

This activism was inspired in part by the Second Great Awakening. The era also saw the rise of the abolitionist movement, the women's rights movement, and the temperance movement. Women did gain the right to vote in state and local elections in several states, but that was not until the late 1800s; women were guaranteed the right to vote in all elections with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment (1920) (A). Dix's activism was not motivated by an economic downturn (B); on the contrary, many historians note that the Second Great Awakening and the market revolution went hand in hand, suggesting such activism occurred in an expanding economy.

The populists grew angry at the concentration of wealth and power by eastern industrialists. They supported a national income tax so that those with higher incomes would pay more than the poor. They also supported free and unlimited coinage of silver. Populists wanted the United States to get off the gold standard and to issue money backed by silver as well.

As the extent of corruption in government became more widely known, from the Grant Administration in Washington to Tammany Hall in New York City, activists demanded reform of local, state, and national governments. Some activists hoped for the formation of the broad coalition described in choice (B), but differences in race, ethnicity, and location made such a coalition untenable.

The United States stated that it would grant the Philippines independence sometime in the future, but for the time being, it held on to the Philippines. Many Filipinos were deeply disappointed in this outcome, hoping to attain independence, as Cuba had following the war. A resistance movement developed in the Philippines and a bloody three-year war, known as the Philippine-American War ensued. Filipino forces were led by Emilio Aguinaldo. The infantilization of the Filipino people in the image can be read on two levels. It serves as a visual pun, comparing Uncle Sam to a parent coming to the realization that a baby is more work than originally thought.

President Jackson believed that the privately run Bank of the United States had too much power over the nation's finances. He thought its power was undemocratic. When Henry Clay and Bank supporters passed a rechartering bill through Congress, Jackson vetoed it. He also pulled federal funds from the Bank of the United States, depositing the money in state banks that came to be known as \"pet banks.\" These banks soon began issuing large amounts of paper money.

Working for a railroad, William \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody killed over 4,000 buffalo to feed construction crews. Military leaders like General Philip Sheridan also encouraged the killing of the buffalo as a means of weakening the Indians.

An intervening swell soon hid them from sight, until, ascending it a quarter of an hour after, we saw close before us the emigrant caravan, with its heavy white wagons creeping on in their slow procession, and a large drove of cattle following behind.\u2026 Many were murmuring against the leader they had chosen, and wished to depose him.\u2026 The women were divided between regrets for the homes they had left and apprehension of the deserts and savages before them.\u2026 As we left the ground, I saw a tall slouching fellow with the nasal accent of \"down east,\" contemplating the contents of his tin cup, which he had just filled with water.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Look here, you,\" he said: \"it's chock full of animals!\"</p><p class=\"indent\">The cup, as he held it out, exhibited in fact an extraordinary variety and profusion of animal and vegetable life.</p><p class=\"right\">\u2014Francis Parkman, <span class=\"italic\">The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life</span>, 1849</p></pre><p>Which of the following had <span class=\"italic\">most</span> directly anticipated and desired the movement described by Parkman?</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A.

In this war, the United States rapidly defeated the Spanish and acquired control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. While there was general agreement that the Cubans would be given their independence, at the time of Beveridge's speech, there was an ongoing debate about what to do with the Philippines. Some argued that the Filipinos, who had risen against their Spanish rulers, should be given independence. Beveridge believed that the United States should govern the Philippines as a colonial possession. His view prevailed, and the United States purchased the Philippines from Spain; the American Army then fought a war against Filipino forces from 1899 to 1902 before securely establishing the authority of the United States in the island chain.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "C"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p class=\"indent\">They ask us how we shall govern these new possessions.

The passage of the Sugar and Stamp Acts set off a chain of new restrictions that set the colonists on the road to revolution. Although you no doubt know the phrase \"No taxation without representation!\" the colonists did not actually want to send colonial representatives to sit in the British Parliament in London. Rather, as the resolutions of the Stamp Act Congress make clear, they believed that only their own colonial legislatures had the power to tax them.

The British responded with the theory of virtual representation, which stated that the colonists were represented in Parliament because members of Parliament represent all British citizens, not just the voters who elected them. Like most political debates, this one reeked of disingenuousness on both sides. The colonists knew that any delegation they sent to Parliament would be essentially powerless; what they really wanted was the right to set their own taxes, not a representative in the legislature.

At the start of the French and Indian War, Benjamin Franklin had proposed the Albany Plan of Union, which was rejected by the colonists in favor of maintaining individual colonial sovereignty.

The French, desperate for cash and nearly as desperate to divest themselves of New World holdings, offered to sell the entire massive Louisiana Territory, giving the United States control of both banks of the Mississippi River (as well as a tremendous amount of western land). As a result, American traders could travel the length of the river unimpeded, and trade subsequently boomed.

Consequently, a group of New England Federalists met in Hartford, Connecticut in 1814 to articulate a list of grievances against the Democratic-Republicans and their policies. While some men suggested secession, others suggested amending the Constitution to protect New England's commercial interests against what they perceived to be a dangerous, growing threat from the agrarian, Republican South. Because we \"defeated\" the British in what is often termed the Second War for Independence, the Federalists were seen as big babies and ultimately discredited. With the election of James Monroe in 1816, the United States had entered the Era of Good Feelings, a relatively brief period when there was only one political party\u2014the Republicans. Although the War of 1812 damaged New England commerce initially, in the long run, the Embargo Act of 1807 and the War of 1812 forced Americans to be less dependent on British goods and indirectly stimulated the growth of industry in antebellum New England.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "A"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>AP US History Practice Questions: Beginnings of Modern American Democracy (1800\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1848)</p></pre><p>Andrew Jackson accused Henry Clay of using his influence to broker the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824 (which cost Andrew Jackson the election) because Clay</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. was promised a cabinet position if John Quincy Adams was elected president</label>", "B": "<label>B. was promised the vice presidency if Jackson was defeated</label>", "C": "<label>C. knew Jackson did not support his \"American System\"</label>", "D": "<label>D. feared Jackson's pro-slavery stance on states' rights</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">A</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>The election of 1824 is one of the more infamous elections in American political history and exposes one of the unanticipated flaws in the Electoral College system. Because of the winner-take-all system of awarding electoral votes in most states, it is possible for a candidate to actually win the popular vote nationwide but lose the election. According to the Constitution, a candidate must win a majority, not a plurality, of electoral votes to win the presidential election. If no one candidate receives the requisite majority, the election is \"thrown into the House,\" and the House of Representatives chooses the president from among the top three candidates. In the event this occurs, each state casts only one vote. Because there were five candidates running for president in 1824, it was almost impossible for anyone to receive a majority. Realizing that he did not have enough support to win the presidency, Henry Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams in exchange for Adams's promise to make Clay his secretary of state.

Tenants would work a piece of land and turn over 50 percent of their crops to the landlord. Often, other expenses, such as rent for a run-down shack or over-priced groceries, available only through the landowner, would be deducted from whatever was produced.

The Free-Soil party attracted anti-slavery \"Conscience\" Whigs, former members of the Liberty party, and pro-Wilmot Proviso Democrats. The Wilmot Proviso was rejected by Congress but suggested that there be no slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico. Free-Soilers were opposed to the extension of slavery into the new territories. Remember: The Constitution protected slavery where it already existed, but many people believed Congress could prevent the further spread of slavery as the United States acquired new land.

By allowing the settlers to decide the slave status of an area, popular sovereignty took some pressure off Congress, which was growing increasingly divided over the issue. It also took pressure off the political parties, which were coming apart due to the irreconcilable regional differences of their members.

Governments of the time were nowhere near as activist as they are today, and only a very few provided even minimal services to immigrants as they accommodated themselves to their new homeland; ethnic communities and churches were expected to provide such services. A number of enterprising, unscrupulous men recognized in these immigrants the opportunity for great political power. Such men, known as political bosses, helped immigrants find homes and jobs and acquire citizenship and voting rights. In essence, these bosses created entire communities, then provided them with all sorts of services: food and loans for the poor, parks and protection for the community. In return, the communities were expected to provide loyal political support, which they did, originally out of loyalty, and later, as the machines became extremely powerful, out of both loyalty and fear. The bosses could then hand an election to a politician of their choice, in return for favors. Political machines filled a need, albeit in an expensive and unethical way.

Once we acquired overseas possessions, a question arose as to the rights and privileges of the native peoples living within the American Empire.

He used the attorney general's office to bring suits to force desegregation of Southern universities and appointed African Americans to prominent positions in his administration but made no effort at civil rights legislation until his final year in office.

The events described are part of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Tensions between the Pueblo people and Spanish conquerors began almost a century before the rebellion. The Spanish conquistador, Juan de Onate, and his soldiers had, in the 1590s, occupied land held by the Acoma Pueblo people. In 1598, in response to Pueblo resistance, Onate responded by firing cannons from a mesa above the Acoma Pueblo people, killing over 800. Resentment of Spanish rule by the Pueblo people intensified by the late 1600s. The Spanish encomienda system had undermined the traditional economy of the Pueblo people. In addition, Spanish officials imposed Christianity on the Pueblo people and outlawed traditional spiritual practices. This resentment led to the Pueblo Revolt, also known as Pope's Rebellion (1680). The rebellion included attacks on the Spanish clergy as well as on ordinary Spaniards. The Pueblo Revolt resulted in over 300 Spanish deaths and a temporary withdrawal of Spanish forces from the area.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p>\"Asked what causes or motives the said Indian rebels had for renouncing the law of God and obedience to his Majesty, and for committing so many kinds of crimes, [Josephe answered] the causes they have were alleged ill treatment and injuries received from [Spanish authorities], because they beat them, took away what they had, and made them work without pay.

At the time, restricting the ability of French immigrants to participate in American politics seemed reasonable to many Americans. Relations between the United States and France deteriorated in the late 1790s. The French Revolution took a violent turn and war broke out between France and Great Britain. France perceived that the United States was favoring Great Britain in the war, and French privateers began to seize American ships. After an American delegation to Paris was rebuffed (the \"XYZ Affair\"), Congress allocated money for a maritime conflict with France. Warships were dispatched to the Caribbean and fought French ships in America's first undeclared war, labeled the Quasi-War (1798\u20131800) by historians.

Senator McCarthy became the central figure in this movement. In 1950 he announced that he had a list of \"known communists\" who had infiltrated the State Department. This and similar claims, mostly baseless, created a name for McCarthy and set the stage for a host of measures to halt this perceived threat. Congress established committees to investigate Communist Party infiltration in different sectors of society. Eisenhower walked a fine line in regard to McCarthy. On the one hand, he found McCarthy's tactics reprehensible.
