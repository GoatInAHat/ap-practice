Also, the exon that follows the alternative exons (exons 2 and 3) for both mRNAs is the same (exon 4). Exon 1 may not necessarily end with a complete codon of three nucleotides and exon 4 may not necessarily begin at the start of a new codon. Therefore, both exons 2 and 3 must pick up where exon 1 ends and add to where exon 4 begins. This requires, at a minimum, that both exons 2 and 3 must have sufficient nucleotides to code for complete codons (that is, 3 nucleotides) and must have, in addition, any extra nucleotides to complete the codons at the end of exon 1 and at the beginning of exon 4. Only answer choice D allows for properly completing any codons at the end of exon 1 or at the beginning of exon 4. If these codons 1 and 4 are not completed by either exon 2 or 3, the resulting processed mRNAs will have a frameshift mutation, resulting in a radically different, and most likely nonfunctional, protein. On the other hand, either exons 2 or 3 can have additional codons (3 nucleotides) that would result in the insertion of one or more additional amino acids into the tropomyosin protein (and that might influence its function). Answer choices B and C could accurately describe some splices, but neither addresses the possibility that the codon that terminates exon 1 and the codon that begins exon 4 might be incomplete with 1 or 2 nucleotides.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><pre class=\"pre-scrollable\"><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/biology/cf/00215.jpg\"/></p><p>Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that produces a buildup of thick mucus in the lungs that leads to constricted airways, persistent coughing, and bacterial infections of the lungs.

Also, there are only three types of membrane receptors (G protein-coupled receptors, ligand-gated ion receptors, and protein kinase receptors), but there are more than 700 known signaling molecules for G protein-coupled receptors alone. Each signaling molecule binds to a specific receptor, initiating a signal transduction pathway that is specific to the signaling molecule and cell type. The PKA produced by the epinephrine signal transduction pathway, then, is going to be different than that of the PKA produced by the adenosine pathway. Since epinephrine is associated with promoting the fight-or-flight response, PKA triggers the release of glucose from glycogen. The release of glucose provides a source of energy for fight-or-flight activities.

According to the figure, at light intensities between 100 and 150 \u03bcmol photons/m<sup><small>2</small></sup>/sec, CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> assimilation in shade leaves is greater than that in sun leaves.

This latter hypothesis occurs because under low light conditions, some cells may be doing photosynthesis while other cells may be doing cellular respiration.

The phosphate group \"head,\" represented in the figure with a circle, is polar and hydrophilic. The fatty acid \"tails,\" shown as wavy lines, are hydrophobic. When immersed in water, the hydrophilic head of a phospholipid orients toward the water molecules and the hydrophobic tails face away from the water. The orientation that satisfies these constraints is a bilayer (or \"sandwich\") with the hydrophilic heads facing the water and the fatty acid tails facing the center of the bilayer. The optimal orientation occurs when a flat bilayer (in which the fatty acid tails at the ends of the bilayer are in contact with water) closes to form a circle (or sphere in three dimensions) as observed in the plasma membranes of cells.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>The end product of the alcohol fermentation pathway is the alcohol ethanol.

First, generating ATP with proton pumps in eukaryotic cells occurs only in these organelles. The other mechanism for generating ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation) occurs in the cytosol by water-soluble enzymes (during glycolysis). Bacteria, which do not have mitochondria or chloroplasts, must use their plasma membrane for ATP generation by proton pumps. Second, as described by endosymbiosis theory, mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria have a common evolutionary origin. The theory explains the origins of eukaryotic cells as the result of a coming together of prokaryotes in a mutualistic, symbiotic relationship: A non-photosynthetic bacterium became a mitochondrion as it merged with a second bacterium that became a eukaryotic animal cell. Similarly, a photosynthetic bacterium became a chloroplast and a non-photosynthetic bacterium became a mitochondrion as both merged with a third bacterium to become a eukaryotic plant cell. These symbiotic assemblages became the ancestors of eukaryotes.

Other enzymes in the metabolic pathway remain functional because adding any one of the supplements ornithine, citrulline, or argininosuccinate will result in the production of arginine. Similarly, the enzyme in mutant II that converts ornithine to citrulline is absent or nonfunctional; adding citrulline or argininosuccinate allows arginine to be produced because the enzymes that convert citrulline to argininosuccinate and the enzyme that converts argininosuccinate to arginine remain functional. In a similar way, mutant III has a nonfunctional enzyme that converts citrulline to argininosuccinate, and mutant IV has a nonfunctional enzyme that converts argininosuccinate to arginine. Because each mutant has only one mutation that inactivates a single enzyme, adding ornithine, citrulline, or argininosuccinate (or all three supplements) to mutant IV does not lead to the production of arginine, as the required enzyme, the one that converts argininosuccinate to arginine, is nonfunctional.

Recombination can still occur if crossing over ensues. But when the genes are very close together, crossing over is not likely, as there is little space between them to break and exchange with a similar break on the homologous chromosome. This is the case in simulation 2: When the genes are linked and no crossing over occurs because they are very close, each parent can provide only two kinds of gametes. But when one of the parents is homozygous recessive for both traits, that parent has only one kind of gamete. For the parents in this question, then, one parent is donating two kinds of gametes that combine (after fertilization) with only one kind of gamete from the second parent. Thus, there are only two kinds of offspring produced. <span class=\"italic\">Watch for these kinds of questions: When the phenotypes of offspring are produced in numbers skewed toward the phenotypes of certain parents, suspect linkage with crossing over.

Generally, the farther the genes are separated on the chromosome, the more often they are likely to cross over (because there are more places between the genes for the chromosome to break and recombine).

As a result, the first nucleotide in every codon will become the second, the second nucleotide will become the third, and the third nucleotide will become the first nucleotide of the next codon. Such an arrangement is likely to change many of the amino acids in the sequence (depending upon where in the sequence the frameshift begins) and, thus, considerably affect the final sequence of the polypeptide. Answer choice D may have no effect at all because a change in the third position of a codon will often code for the same amino acid. (This results from the \"wobble\" of the third position of the tRNA anticodon.) Answer choice B will result in a missing amino acid, while answer choice C will change one amino acid to a different amino acid. These changes may alter the effectiveness of the polypeptide, but not as severely as changing many amino acids, as would occur in answer choice A. The inherited disorder sickle-cell anemia is caused by the replacement of one amino acid by another in two chains of the hemoglobin protein, severely reducing the effectiveness of hemoglobin in carrying oxygen.
