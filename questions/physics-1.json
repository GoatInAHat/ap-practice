The forces provided by Bob and Tom must add up to 500 N, the weight of the rod. Try doing two quick calculations: In the original case, Bob and Tom must each bear 250 N of weight and are each 2 m from the midpoint, for 500 N\u00b7m of torque each. Now put Tom farther from the midpoint-say, 3 m away. For the torques to balance, F<sub>bob</sub>(2 m) = F<sub>tom</sub>(3 m). The only way to satisfy this equation and get both forces to add up to 500 N is to use 300 N for F<sub>bob</sub> and 200 N for F<sub>tom</sub>.

Since the wagon is on a horizontal surface, the potential energy change is zero; the work done by the 30-N pulling force is the change in the wagon's KE. Work is force times parallel displacement, so we don't use 30 N in this formula, we use the component of the 30-N force parallel to the 20-m displacement.

Using the best-fit line drawn as the top of a triangle, the area is (1/2) \u00d7 (300 N)(20 cm) = 3,000 N.cm.* Now, put your ruler along the data points. Try to draw another line that's still a reasonable best fit, but is a bit shallower. Where does that line intersect the 20-cm position? It intersects at a point probably not much below 280 N, maybe even 290 N. The smallest possible work done, given this data, would be area = (1/2)(280 N)(20 cm) = 2,800 N.cm, which is 200 N.cm short of the 3,000 N.cm original estimate. That's closest to Choice C.

Imagine each object has total mass of 2 kg. Begin by comparing objects A and B: To find the net torque on object A, assume the entire 20 N weight is concentrated at the dot representing the rod's center of mass. That's located 10 cm from the pivot, giving a net torque of 200 N\u00b7cm. For object B, consider the torques provided by each block separately. The right block provides a torque of (10 N)(30 cm) = 300 N\u00b7cm clockwise; the left block provides a torque of (10 N)(10 cm) = 100 N\u00b7cm counterclockwise. That makes the net torque 200 N\u00b7cm, the same as for object A. But object B has more rotational inertia, since its 2 kg of mass are concentrated farther away from the pivot than object A's mass. So the denominator of the angular acceleration equation is bigger for object B with the same numerator, which means A &gt; B.</p><p>Now consider object C. It experiences less net torque than A and B. Calculate (10 N)(30 cm) = 300 N\u00b7cm clockwise, and (10 N)(20 cm) = 200 N\u00b7cm counterclockwise for a net torque of 100 N\u00b7cm. And object C has the same mass distributed even farther from the pivot point than either of the other two objects, giving C an even bigger rotational inertia. In the angular acceleration equation, object C gives a smaller numerator and a bigger denominator than object B, meaning C &lt; B.

A given force stretches each spring by a certain amount. When the springs are connected in series, the increases in length add together, but the tension forces don't. Thus, the object must move a larger distance to experience the same force from the springs. This is consistent with a reduced spring constant. Choice (D) is the only answer in which the new spring constant is less than the original, <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>. If you want to see a proof, consider a situation in which the block is displaced some distance <i>x</i> from the equilibrium position. The first spring would be displaced some amount <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, and the second spring would be displaced some amount <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>. Then you can say <i>x</i> = <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>. Knowing that, <i>F</i> = -<i>kx</i> for all springs, you can say <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> = -<i>F</i>/<i>k</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> = -<i>F</i>/<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>. Substituting those into the first equation gives <i>x</i> = <img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_045_Image_0003.jpg\"/>.

In this problem, <i>\u03b8</i> will always be 90 degrees, and sin 90\u00b0 = 1, so that term will be neglected for the rest of the explanation.

Choices (C) and (D) would both affect the speed of the wave, which would change the wavelength because <i>v</i> = <i>f</i>\u03bb; the frequency of the wave would not change, meaning that the wavelength would change proportionally to the speed. Choice (B) is correct because pressure has no effect on the speed of sound. If the speed and frequency both remain constant, then the wavelength must as well.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p><b>Question below</b> refers to the circuit below:</p><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_444_Image_0004.jpg\"/></p><p>What is the total resistance of the circuit?</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. 13 \u03a9</label>", "B": "<label>B. 11 \u03a9</label>", "C": "<label>C. 8 \u03a9</label>", "D": "<label>D. 6 \u03a9</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">D</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><b>D</b></p><p>The equivalent resistance of <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>3</sub> is</p><p class=\"center\"><i>R</i><sub>2+3</sub> = <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> + <i>R</i><sub>3</sub> = 1 \u03a9 + 2 \u03a9 = 3 \u03a9</p><p>The equivalent resistance of <i>R</i><sub>2+3</sub> and <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> is</p><p class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_462_Image_0001.jpg\"/></p><p class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_462_Image_0002.jpg\"/></p><p>The total resistance of the circuit then is</p><p class=\"center\"><i>R</i><sub>Tot</sub> = <i>R</i><sub>1+2+3</sub> + R4 = 2 \u03a9 + 4 \u03a9 = 6 \u03a9</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p><b>Question below</b> refers to the circuit below:</p><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_444_Image_0004.jpg\"/></p><p>How long will it take for the battery to deliver 300 J of energy to the circuit?</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. 6 s</label>", "B": "<label>B. 12 s</label>", "C": "<label>C. 18 s</label>", "D": "<label>D. 24 s</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">C</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p><b>C</b></p><p>The power of the circuit is equal to</p><p class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_462_Image_0003.jpg\"/></p><p>The amount of time it would take for the battery to deliver 300 J of energy is equal to</p><p class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/physics-1/cr20/Prin_9780525568292_xp_all_r1_Page_462_Image_0004.jpg\"/></p>\n</div>", "correct": "C"}]
