Since monopolies produce lower quantities of a good, the consumer and producer surplus is lower. A lack of competition can also result in goods of inferior quality.

The quantity of a good demanded is completely insensitive to price changes (perfectly inelastic) when the demand curve is vertical. Because cigarettes are addictive, and life-sustaining pills are necessary, the quantities of these goods demanded are likely to be relatively insensitive to price (inelastic). This brings us down to a choice between all soda pop and Sprite. Because there are far more substitutes available for Sprite than there are for all types of soda pop, the demand for Sprite will be more elastic than the demand for all soda pop.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "D"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>What are the effects on the supply and demand curves for Frisbees if a new procedure reduces the cost of making Frisbees?</p><p><b>Demand Curve \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Supply Curve</b></p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A.

All of the rows and columns exhibit some decreasing marginal returns, so it is incorrect to say that all of the relevant numbers in the table are consistent with either constant or increasing marginal returns. Economies of scale exist when the long-run average cost is decreasing as output increases, as would be the case with increasing returns to scale. Along the diagonal 3 to 6 to 9 trees, we see that output increases in proportion to the amounts of each of the inputs.

Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice might lead people to put off some of their purchases of orange juice until the price drops, thus decreasing demand (shifting it to the left).

And both monopolies and monopolistically competitive firms must lower their price in order to sell more units of their output. The correct answer is (B): The marginal revenue is below the demand curve for monopolies because they must lower their price in order to sell more. Because they lower the price in order to sell one more unit, the marginal revenue is not the price as indicated on the demand curve, but that price minus the lost earnings on all of the previous units that are now selling at a lower price.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "B"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p><img src=\"https://img.crackap.com/ap/eco/cr2017/00092.jpg\"/></p><p>Based on the PPF in the figure, the opportunity cost of producing the seventh carrot is</p></div>", "answers": {"A": "<label>A. 2 tomatoes</label>", "B": "<label>B. 3 tomatoes</label>", "C": "<label>C. 5 tomatoes</label>", "D": "<label>D. 8 tomatoes</label>", "E": "<label>E. the slope of the PPF</label>"}, "explanation": "<div class=\"hidden\" id=\"answer\">\n<p id=\"result\"></p>\n<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <span id=\"key\">A</span></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>A   When the seventh carrot is produced, production of tomatoes goes from 10 to 8, so the opportunity cost is 2 tomatoes.

A horizontal demand curve simply means that the one good has a perfectly elastic demand, and says nothing about its relationship with another particular good, thus ruling out (B). The cross-price elasticity is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of one good divided by the percentage change in the price of another good. If an increase in the price of one good (movie tickets) causes an increase in the quantity of the other good (movie rentals) demanded, the cross-price elasticity is positive and the goods are substitutes. If an increase in the price of one good (gasoline) causes a decrease in the quantity of the other good demanded (sports utility vehicles), the cross-price elasticity is negative and the two goods are complements.</p>\n</div>", "correct": "C"}, {"content": "<div class=\"content\"><p>Education makes Chris a better worker, voter, parent, and citizen.
