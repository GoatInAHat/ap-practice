Choice (B) explains the vertical section of the AS curve. Inaccurate information within firms about how their prices compare to the overall price level can fool firms into producing more at higher prices if they don't realize that the prices for everything else are going up at the same time. Higher price levels will not allow sellers to purchase more output from other sellers because an increase in the price level means that, on the average, prices for output in general have increased. Thus, just as sellers are receiving more for their goods, they must also pay more for goods that they purchase. Wages and other input prices that adjust more slowly than output prices can provide a profit incentive for firms to produce more at higher price levels because their revenues increase by more than their costs.

Government spending is a component of aggregate demand/aggregate expenditure, and therefore a change in government spending will change aggregate expenditure by that amount. The increase in taxes will cause a decrease in consumption; however, consumption will not change by the same amount as the tax increase, as people will change their consumption based on the MPC. In this case the MPC is 0.75, so consumption will only change by 75 percent of the amount of tax change. Thus, the overall effect in this situation is expansionary. Cross out (C), (D), and (E).
