Initially, individuals and families that moved to the suburbs commuted back to the city for work, a process accommodated by the automobile and improved highway systems. Even today, when commuting patterns don't always lead to the central business district (CBD), the suburban way of life still depends on the automobile, which leads to increased pollution levels. Additionally, as people continue to move out from the city, the city's tax base suffers, causing rundown in the infrastructure, vacant buildings, and substandard education and housing opportunities.
